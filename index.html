        <p>During my study I found myself creating lots of empty docs that I would title "practice" or "test" and came to realize that I forget what these sections are and what I was testing. I figured making sections for these test sections will be better by creating a site that holds all my tests and that will  help me remember tips to problems.</p>

            <h2>HTML</h2>
            <div class="html__container">
                <h3>Forms and Dialogs</h3>
                <p>If we we want to include a form and a dialog, we will place the form inside the dialog.</p>
                <h3>backdrop of dialog boxes</h3>
                <p>The CSS ::backdrop pseudo-element can be used to style the backdrop of a modal dialog, which is displayed behind the dialog element when the dialog is displayed using the HTMLDialogElement.showModal() method. For example, you can use this pseudo-element to obfuscate (hide) the inert content behind the modal dialog.</p>
                <h3>method dialog and formmethod='dialog'</h3>
                <p>HTML form elements can be used to close a dialog box if they have the attribute method="dialog" or if the button used to submit the form has formmethod="dialog" set.The returnValue property gets set to the value of the button that was activated.</p>
                <h3>Open attribute of dialog boxes</h3>
                <p>Dialog boxes should not use the open attribute, we should only focus on showModal and modal in javascript. If we do use open, there would be no way to reopen unless we add and remove the open attribute, which is not good practice.</p>
                <h3>What are Dialog boxes?</h3>
                <p>A modal or non-modal dialog box, which means modal dialog boxes interrupt interaction with the rest of the page being inert, while non-modal dialog boxes allow interaction with the rest of the page.</p>
                <h3>If using dialog boxes, how should this be controlled?</h3>
                <p>javaScript should be used to display the dialog element. Use the .showModal() method to display a modal dialog and the .show() method to display a non-modal dialog. The dialog box can be closed using the .close() method or using the dialog method when submitting a form </p>
                <h3>Dialog and return values</h3>
                <p></p>
                <h3>Forms</h3>
                <p>Creating forms we will start with the first image.The action tells us the URL for where to send the data, eventually the backend will be added here. The method tells us which HTTP request we want, POST or GET</p>
                <img src="./Images/basicFormStart.png" alt="">
                <p>Next we want to add our form controls. One of the most popular and versatile being input. Input we can add all types of info, but all inputs should have a label. Eventually, under the input we will also add a name attribute. The name attribute tells the backend what each data represents.</p>
                <img src="./Images/formLabel.png" alt="">
                <p>Lastly, we can create special buttons that all make user experience with forms easier. With the types being submit, reset, and button(generic button used anywhere else on the site).</p>
                <h3>Grouping Forms</h3>
                <p>Sometimes we want to group similar things to make the UI and code look readable. We can use fieldsets for that. However, ss you can see in the examples, it's common practice to wrap a label and its widget with a li element within a ul or ol list, or even with a div or p. The second image just shows how we can use divs to separate, but ps could have been fine too.</p>
                <img src="./Images/fieldSet.png" alt="">
                <img src="./Images/formpDIV.png" alt="">
                <p>Another important text grouping will be legends, which allows the code to look more together.The fieldset element is a convenient way to create groups of widgets that share the same purpose, for styling and semantic purposes. You can label a fieldset by including a legend element just below the opening fieldset tag. The text content of the legend formally describes the purpose of the fieldset it is included inside.</p>
                <img src="./Images/formLegend.png" alt="">
                <h3>Form styles</h3>
                <p>Styling forms can be hard and tricky. First we need to make sure they are inheriting the parent styling, <code>button,
                    input,
                    select,
                    textarea {
                    font-family: inherit;
                    font-size: 100%;
                    }</code> However, some people argue the default looks better, but the choice is yours to make.</p>
                    <p>Another important "reset" will be to make sure all widgets occupy the same space. <code>input,
                        textarea,
                        select,
                        button {
                        width: 150px;
                        padding: 0;
                        margin: 0;
                        box-sizing: border-box;
                        }</code> this should have all widgets take the same amount of width.</p>
                    <p>styling the legend uses the positions to move it around. Since a legend will always be included in a fieldset we can set that to relative, and the legend to absolute, and move like that. Also, focus is important, when one of these fields gains focus, we highlight them with a light grey, transparent, background (it is always important to have focus style, for usability and keyboard accessibility): </p>
                <h3>The hard Styles, radios and checkboxes</h3>
                <p>For these, we want to use appearance none in the css to remove the default look. <code>input[type="checkbox"] {
                    appearance: none;
                }</code> The fourth image shows a custom radio design.</p>
                <img src="./Images/apperanceNone.png" alt="">
                <img src="./Images/checkBoxStyle.png" alt="">
                <img src="./Images/hardFormStyle.png" alt="">
                <img src="./Images/labelStyleInsteadOfFileINput.png" alt="">
                <img src="./Images/customRadios.png" alt="">
                <h3>Pseudo-classes Forms</h3>
                <p>For required, we can remember that input,select, and textarea have a built in required attribute. And likewise, all others can use optional. These classes are also used when we want to make custom radio buttons. Some classes, like emails, have built in valid/invalid validation.</p>
                <img src="./Images/pseudoClassesForm.png" alt="">
                <img src="./Images/req:optionalForm.png" alt="">
                <p>Common radio button animation and will work when checked. If something is unchecked, we can use the pseudo of indeterminate. Note, we use transform origin instead of display since this lets the pulse start from the center.</p>
                <img src="./Images/radioButtonAnimation.png" alt="">
                <p>This is an indeterminate radio, they will pulse until one is clicked upon.</p>
                <img src="./Images/indeterminateForm.png" alt="">

                <h3>Valid invalids forms</h3>
                <p>When we want to add extra flair to forms, we can target the valid and invalid classes, where if invalid/valid, they will show with a custom content.</p>
                <img src="./Images/validInvalidForms.png" alt="">
                <h3>Form Validation</h3>
                <p>Form validation only comes in 5 flavors, requried,minlength/maxlength,min/max (number entry only), type (number vs email vs etc), and pattern (uses regex for like zipcode).</p>
                <h3>FORM EXAMPLE</h3>
                <p>
                    <form action=""></form>
                </p>
                <h3>When to use articles?</h3>
                <p>Articles are stand alone sections. Think of blog posts, newspaper article,a comment or independent gadget. </p>
                <h3>Removing lists bullet points</h3>
                <p>To remove the bullet points in lists, you will use list-style: none</p>
                <h3>Quickly open the terminal</h3>
                <p>To quickly open a terminal simply press fn + f12</p>
                <h3>Opening inspect tool</h3>
                <p>To avoid right clicking and hitting inspect every time, it's faster to just hit command + option + c
                </p>
                <h3>How to add or change HTML</h3>
                <p>To add HTML onto a page with inspect, simply right click and hit the EDIT with HTML option and now we can.</p>
                <h3>How to apply classes in devtools</h3>
                <p>First open dev tools, next click on what section you want to test a class on with the selector arrow. Next you want to click on .cls which is found right under the index.html but above where the styles are seen. After you click on it you just need to type the class name</p>
                <h3>How to quickly select with the pointer in dev tools</h3>
                <p><kbd>command + shift + c</kbd></p>
                <h3>How to test all hover effects</h3>
                <p>open dev tools, then click on :hov. This section in of itself does not apply the hover selection, it would need to be selected after. </p>
                <h3>Debugging and changing CSS animations</h3>
                <p>Open dev tools on Google Chrome, then select the three vertical dots, more tools, and then click on animations. To see the animations captured the page will need to be refreshed or the animation played.</p>
                <h3>Readability with contrast ratio check</h3>
                <p>First select the element you want to select. Then select the color used for that element. Then select contrast ratio. Anything within the lines is the min requirement for readability. Anything below is better.</p>
                <p>An alternative method is by going into more tools and selecting CSS overview in the event the contrast ratio does not show up.</p>
                <h3>How to find quick selections</h3>
                <p>To find areas of the dev tools, <kbd>command + shift + p</kbd> one example will be to perform a screenshot of the page, open the shortcut above, and then type screenshot.</p>
                <h3>What is the difference in kbd vs code?</h3>
                <p>KBD is for user input while code is for a fragment in computer code</p>
                <h3>Ways to debug JS</h3>
                <p>Four of the most common ways to debug JS
                    <ol class="listMarginLeft__40px">
                        <li><code>console.log(var)</code></li>
                        <li><code>console.log({var})</code></li>
                        <li><code>console.table(var)</code></li>
                        <li><code>console.trace(var)</code></li>
                    </ol>
                    When debugging it's best to replicate what causes the bug first. Open the console with <kbd>command + option + j</kbd> (only on chrome) then move to sources. Now open the Event Listener Breakpoints, for clicks we will got o mouse, then on clicks. Now when you click on a button, it will highlight that line of code. If incorrect line, hit the resume button, located right above the the yellow bar that says our code has been paused. When we feel we know where the bug occurs, we can set a breakpoint by clicking to the left of the JS file number and set a blue arrow, this will now pause here when we resume the call with the pause start button mentioned before. Make  a change in the JS code with saving with <kbd>command + s</kbd> to save, and then test the button again.

                </p>
                <h3>debug Functions</h3>
                <p>Easy way to debug function is to call debug(functionName), however make sure it is in scope.</p>
                <h3>Rearrange the DOM in the dev tools</h3>
                <p>To reorder the DOM, simply drag and drop in the dev tools.</p>
                <h3>Force states</h3>
                <p>Select an element in the dev tools and right click it, change pseudo class, and then select whatever you want.</p>
                <h3>Hide a Node</h3>
                <p>Select the element in the dev tools, then hit <kbd>H</kbd></p>
                <h3>Copy a selected Element as a JS path</h3>
                <p>Select the element (in google chrome only),right click on the dev tools, and then copy as a JS path.</p>
                <h3>BEM naming conventions</h3>
                <p>This area will be solely dedicated to naming conventions of popular styling </p>
                <img class="images" src="./Images/BEM__listEx.png" alt="BEM list example">
                <h3>How to take screenshots of code in VS</h3>
                <p>Highlight the portion of the code you want to screenshot. Next, right click on SnapCode. Last, when the new window opens up, click on the logo and then save it where you want to find it.</p>
                <h3>Lazy Loading with HTML</h3>
                <p>On images we can use a shorthand for lazy loading with the attribute loading. Some drawbacks are that not all browsers support it, but it can helpful on speeding up a page.</p>
                <img loading="lazy" src="./Images/lazyLoading.png" alt="">
                <h3>How to open links in a separate tab.</h3>
                <p>When using a link tag, use <code>target="_blank"</code>, this causes a new tab to be open while not overwriting other opened links.</p>
                <h3>Use of Labels and select</h3>
                <p>whenever we want a dropdown function, we will use select and the children will be options.
                    <label for="weather">Select the weather type today: </label>
                    <select id="weather">
                    <option value="">--Make a choice--</option>
                    <option value="sunny">Sunny</option>
                    <option value="rainy">Rainy</option>
                    <option value="snowing">Snowing</option>
                    <option value="overcast">Overcast</option>
                    </select>
                </p>
                <img src="./Images/labelAndSelect.png" alt="">
                <h3>To show potential repairs</h3>
                <p>To show potential repairs open the command line with <kbd>command + shift + p</kbd> and then type Rendering, this will open a new menu with lots of helps, look under paint flashing. </p>
                <h3>To add or remove classes</h3>
                <p>click on the .cls tab and enter new classes, or remove the check marks to disable others.</p>
                <h3>Easy Edits: shadow and transform</h3>
                <p>For easy movement, go to google chrome see the Angle clock for any transform properties, and use the square layers to check for shadows with blurriness and X and Y offset.</p>
                <h3>Easy Breakpoints for media queries</h3>
                <p>To change Media Queries break points, first make it into mobile mode, then select the ... options., then select show media queries. Once selected, click on the top of the bars, the blue and orange bars to select the break points.</p>
                <h3>Add pseudo to images and choosing images based on mobile vs desktop viewing</h3>
                <p>When using images, it's best to set a width and height to the image themselves. Also, when wanting a change of images, images must be instead placed in source tags, and all of the sources placed inside a picture semantics, works similar to a div.Play around with the html height and see how it behaves. Also, see if you can see the difference from mobile design at 360px and below and those above, it's subtle but there!</p>
                <picture>
                    <source media="(max-width:360px)" srcset="./Images/pictureExampleHTML-m.png">
                    <!-- typically you will include this other source and the img is actually the fall back -->
                    <!-- <source media="(max-width:361px)" srcset="./Images/pictureExampleHTML.png"> -->
                    <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="500px" height="500px" src="./Images/pictureExampleHTML.jpg" alt="htmlHeightWidth">
                </picture>
                <h3>Decoding async</h3>
                <p>The decoding="async" attribute will tell the browser that it is OK for image decoding to be done at a later moment so that the browser can continue displaying content even if the images are not fully loaded</p>

                <h3>Center Absolute</h3>
                <p>To center things absolute we can do the classic left :50%, top: 50%; translate: transform(-50%,-50%)  OR we can do inset:0; margin: auto.</p>
                <h3>Example frameworks</h3>
                <p>Some frameworks are tailwind and bootstrap. Just bundles of CSS to cuts down on common issues.</p>
                <h3>Examples of preprocessor</h3>
                <p>LESS,SASS and stylus fall under these, these are pretty much adding extra functionality that can be helpful.</p>

                </p>
                    <h3>Pseudo classes vs pseudo elements</h3>
                    <p>Classes have colons and act as a class and is a selector, like first child, or hover. <code>article p:first-child</code> is a class that select the first p element child in the parent article. An element acts as if we added HTML onto the markup, like before and after. If we wanted to look for types, like images, or paragraphs we can use :first-of-type, :last-of-type, & :only-of-type <code>p:first-of-type {...}
                        p:last-of-type {...}
                        img:only-of-type {...}</code></p>
                        <h3>Structural pseudo-classes</h3>
                        <p>:nth-child(n), :nth-last-child(n), :nth-of-type(n), and :nth-last-of-type(n)where n is the number of expressions. To add complexity, li:nth-child(3n) will be every increment of 3, 2n+1  is every odd, 2n is every even,li:nth-child(4n+7) is every 4 but starting at 7.</p>
                <h3>Example of Calc</h3>
                <p>:root {
                    --header: 3rem;
                    --footer: 40px;
                    --main: calc(100vh - calc(var(--header) + var(--footer))); 
                    } here we are styling the top and bottom, and knowing this, we can calc the correct height needed to the main content.</p>
                    <h3>Max vs Min</h3>
                    <p>Both seem similar but think of it like this, if you make the page larger, max will grow it, and when moved smaller it will eventually lock. If using min, when grown will lock eventually, but when shrinking, will change.</p>
                    <h3>Most ideal width for text</h3>
                    <p><code>p {
                        width: clamp(45ch, 50%, 75ch);
                      }</code></p>

                <h3>The Meyer Reset</h3>
                <p>One of the most common resets that exists. Found here <a href="https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/">resets</a></p>
                <h3>EM and REM</h3>
                <p>Both are typically used for font sizers, but we will almost always prefer to use REM since em is based on the <b>PARENT</b> font size and get lead to issues if that changes. So, use REM.</p>
                <h3>Screen sizes</h3>
                <p>Common screen sizes <code>@media only screen and (min-width:0em)</code> Mobile
                <br>
                <code>@media only screen and (min-width:48em )</code> Tablet
                <br>
                <code>@media only screen and (min-width:64em)</code> Small Desktop
                <br>
                <code>@media only screen and (min-width:1300px )</code> Large Desktop
                </p>
                <h3>Playwright</h3>
                <p>Look into microsoft playwright, apparently simulates different websites and helps fixes differences.</p>
                <h3>Relative and Absolute</h3>
                <p>Position relative is based off its relative position but can be adjusted with left,top,right,and bottom. The power of Relative is that it make position absolute relative to position relative.</p>
                <h3>FontAwesome</h3>
                <p>The best way to add FontAwesome will be to add it via download. The file at the moment would need to be downloaded each time and then moved either into it's own folder on the site you're working on in VS code.Next, you will need to move down the file until you hit css/all.min. Another think you can do is delete the other files in FontAwesome to save some space, ie anything in JS and less. </p>
                <h3>Other choices of font</h3>
                <p> for font pairs I recommend going to <a href="https://www.fontpair.co/">font pairs</a><a target="_blank"href="https://www.fontspace.com/collection">Font spacen</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.dafont.com/">Dafont</a></p>
                <h3>Choice of Border Color</h3>
                <p>Choosing a border the color of the main text seems best, choose your color and lower the opacity until you get the desire color.</p>
                <h3>Background-size vs Background-position</h3>
                <p>Background-size has to do with how large the img should behave, this is where we see contain and cover. Contain being it showing the whole img, and if it doesn't cover the whole area the empty space will take up the background-color prop, but the img will never be cropped.cover is when the img filled the container fully, and does crop the img if the container isn't large enough.Background-position has to do with where you want the img to be viewed, this is the one where you use center,left,right,etc</p>
                <h3>Color Scheme: How to choose your colors</h3>
                <p>First go into the following site <a href="https://realtimecolors.com/?colors=0f0906-f1e2da-766a2e-e3eccf-232c11">example colors</a> or for more freedom <a href="https://www.designspiration.com/search/saves/?q=colour" target="_blank">Color Picker</a>, and to help narrow the search on colors think of a couple things 
                <ol class="listMarginLeft__40px">
                <li>Target Audience, a funeral home vs fast food will use different colors.</li>
                <li>Does the Logo offer any colors?</li>
                <li>Play the word game, write down things that remind you of your site, and you should think of what color define these.</li>
                </ol>
                some quick tips, a lighter shade works more for fresh energy brands, while darker ones are more for corporate serious brands. Next you want to keep in mind that most sites will use three base colors, white, gray, and a light gray. With this in mind, you will choose only a base color, the color you choose when you were thinking of a color at the list above,and an accent color. Once you have your color, go to <a href="https://paletton.com/#uid=1000u0kllllaFw0g0qFqFg0w0aF" target="_blank">accent color finder</a>.Enter your color into the wheel, and then click on add complimentary color near right of the selections. The color red below is #FFA5A5 and acts as the accent while the green below is #9AEE9C,and acts as the base color. After the accent, you will use two different grays, a darker and lighter one.The dark one is used for text. The gray needed can be find by entering your based color into the search bar of <a href="https://dribbble.com/" target="_blank">Dribble</a>  followed by the word website,and find a gray that matches your color choice.
                <div class="colorChooser__baseAndAccentColor"></div>
                The main color will be used for large areas and icons. The accent color for buttons and smaller areas, call to action areas.Dark gray for text and icon outlines, and the white and light gray are used for the background.
                Another tip will be to set everything to gray scale and then add color later.

                <h3>Adjusted img width</h3>
                <p>To avoid changing the proportion of an image, we can focus instead on just changing the width of the image. This is done by setting the height:auto, width to whatever size you want it to be. It's best to add a width and height to images even if you don't plan on changing them. The reasoning is that by adding a width and height, the page will load the white space it plans to take up, and won't cause sudden slow down once the rest of the content loads in. Another note, if a width hasn't been decided, setting a <code>max-width:100%</code> is a good fall back since it'll fit the size of the viewport. </p>
                <h3>Low Cost Animations</h3>
                <p>Most animations should fall within these four, if not,they will use up much more memory

                <h3>box-sizing: border-box</h3>
                <p>The purpose of border-box involves the box model, where the padding and border are included in the height of the element. With border-box, if you enter <code>width: 100px; height:100px;</code>the element will be exactly 100px by 100px. To showcase this, if you have <code>padding:10px; border:10px solid; height:100px; width:100px</code> .Without border box the total width and height will be 140px x 140px since we gave the content 100px x 100px but then the padding and border are added after, changing the height and width.  With border box, the height x width of the content will be 60px x 60px; with the padding and border taking up their 20px x 20px each.The height and width of the element of the whole will now be 100px x 100px as intended</p>
                <p>To further explore this, this is taken from <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/The_box_model">Web Docs</a>. <em>"In the standard box model, if you give a box a width and a height attribute, this defines the width and height of the content box. Any padding and border is then added to that width and height to get the total size taken up by the box. The actual space taken up by the box will be 410px wide (350 + 25 + 25 + 5 + 5) and 210px high (150 + 25 + 25 + 5 + 5)."</em></p>
                <p> 
                    <code>.box {
                    width: 350px;
                    height: 150px;
                    margin: 10px;
                    padding: 25px;
                    border: 5px solid black;}
                    </code>

                <h3>Outer display</h3>
                    <h4>Display Block</h4>
                    <p>An outer display. A block will take up its own line, it will take up the full width of the container, and border,margin, and padding will push things away from it.</p>
                    <h4>Display inline</h4>
                    <p>An outer display.A new line won't be made, height and width won't apply, only horizontal padding,margins, and border will push things away.</p>
                <h3>Inner Display</h3>
                    <h4>Display: Flex</h4>
                    <p>With Display: Flex the outer display will be block,but the inner display will now be flexed.</p>

                <h3>Margin Collapsing</h3>
                <p>If two elements margin touch, they won't combine, they would just be the marin of the larger of the two. If one is negative, then they would subtract from the larger of the two. <em> "The top paragraph has a margin-bottom of 50 pixels. The second paragraph has a margin-top of 30 pixels. The margins have collapsed together so the actual margin between the boxes is 50 pixels and not the total of the two margins." - <a href="http://127.0.0.1:5501/index.html#">Web Doc</a></em> <strong>This only applies for vertical margins.</strong> </p>
                <h3>Border Styling</h3>
                <p>While border shorthand is the fastest way to do it, the alternative will be to use border-style,border-color, and color-width. For more advanced styling each width,style, and color can be used with border-(top,right,bottom,left)-(width,style,color)</p>
                <h3>Padding values</h3>
                <p>Padding does not take negative values.</p>
                <h3>Inline-block</h3>
                <p>Since padding does not effect inline elements like <code>a</code> and <code>span</code>, using inline-block allows us to make sure these don't form on a new line, but allows us to apply padding,height,width, and does now all overlapping</p>
                <h3>Margin Auto Horizontal Centering</h3>
                <p>Auto will usually be 0, or whatever space is available on the side. For this to work, you need a defined width.Then set margin as <code>margin: 0 auto</code>.<strong>This only works for horizontal centering</strong></p>
                <h3>Justify-content</h3>
                <p>Justify-content works with placing flex items without having to change the width on the main axis.</p><ul class="listMarginLeft__40px">
                    <li>Space-between</li>
                    <p>Space between makes sure that each space between them are laid out evenly, any after that is not between another item is not accounted for, which is why you have the first item and last item pushed all the way to the ends.</p>
                    <li>Space-around</li>
                    <p>Space around causes the spacing between items to be the same, but gives the last and first item equal space to the left and right of the ends.</p>
                    <li>Space-evenly</li>
                    <p>Space-evenly causes all spaces to be even, including the end points.</p>
                </ul>
                <img src="./Images/justifyContent.svg" alt="">
                <h3>align-items</h3>
                <p>align-items works by placing items on the cross axis, which is typically vertical.</p>
                <h3>Main axis vs cross axis</h3>
                <p>Taken from the  <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-alignment" target="_blank">Odin Project</a>.<em> "Because justify-content and align-items are based on the main and cross axis of your container, their behavior changes when you change the flex-direction of a flex-container. For example, when you change flex-direction to column, justify-content aligns vertically and align-items aligns horizontally."</em></p>

                <img src="./Images/crossAxisColumn.png" alt="">
                <h3>Flex-shrink</h3>
                <p>When a flex items is not taken up as much space as you would like, try giving it a flex-shrink of 0, this causes the item to not grow smaller.</p>
                <h3>Flex-Wrap</h3>
                <p>Flex wrap allows us to negate the shrinking ability of flex to fit on a line that too small for the container.Instead it will force the object to form a new line.Two properties of flex-wrap will be nowrap and wrap.</p>
                <h3>align-items, align-self, and align-content</h3>
                <p>Align items and self both control alignment but self only effects one item on the flex container while items effects all. Align content effect each new line of flex, as seen with <code>flex-wrap: wrap</code> if it needs one.For it to work, we need more height than what is required to hold the items. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Aligning_Items_in_a_Flex_Container" target="_blank">for a link to see how this works.</a></p>
                <h3>How to isolate justify-content</h3>
                <p>Justify-content does not have self or items so aligning single items doesn't work as you would expect.If we want to separate things in a nar bar we would use <code>margin-left:auto;</code>. This forces the flex items to push all the way to the right if space is available. </p>
                <h3>Justify-content flex-end</h3>
                <p>While all the other justify-content choices  are interesting, don't forget the power of flex-end and start, very easy way to push things left or right.</p>
                <h3>Flex Auto for longer text with shorter text</h3>
                <p>Flex auto works as if we enter <code>flex: 1 1 auto;</code> all items will grow and shrink from a flex-basis of auto. This would mean the longer items would take more space.</p>
                <h3>Having a flex item take most of the space</h3>
                <p>In most instances,such in forms, we can have the text take most of the available space by setting <code>flex:1 1 auto;</code></p>

                <h3>Nav bar with controlled left and right spacing</h3>
                <p>Remember that if using ul elements, there margins and paddings must be set to 0. Using <code>justify-content:space-between</code> will push things all to the way to the left and right, but if the main container flex has a padding on the left and right, they <strong>WON'T</strong> be pushed into the padding, making a space to the left and right. </p>

                <img src="./Images/space-betweenSpacing.png" alt="">
                <h3>Line-Height</h3>
                <p>Line height for best reading should best be set to 1.5, <code>line-height:1.5;</code>. Note: A unit can be added, but 1.5 without a unit is the best standard.</p>
                <h3>Flex height issue</h3>
                <p>Sometimes we want to have the item be center page but want to avoid doing height math. This can be fixed by placing the whole area in a <code>display: flex</code> and then giving what you want to be center a <code>flex:1</code></p>
                <h3>::before ::after</h3>
                <p>In order to do before and after, we must selection <strong>CONTAINERS</strong>, examples of containers are <kbd>DIV,p,articles,sections,etc</kbd>. Examples of things that are <strong>NOT</strong> containers are <kbd>inputs,buttons,imgs,etc.</kbd>
                <h3>Pointer Events</h3>
                <p>In some designs you will have things overlap, in order to remove interference in clickable events, simply use pointer-events.</p>
                <img src="./Images/pointerEventCS.png" alt="">
                <h3>Display Grid</h3>
                <p>Display grid is the other option to display flex and works when dealing with detailed placement of items</p>
                <h3>Common Grid Container Properties</h3>
                <p>
                    <ul class="listMarginLeft__40px">
                        <li>grid-template-columns or rows - gives the spacing of the grid tracks, similar to padding. Can be given names with brackets.</li>
                        <img src="./Images/gridNamingGridTemplate.png" alt="">
                        <li>grid-template-columns repeat - used if there are repeating parts. How many times do we want to call it. Ie, we want 3 items to each taken a fraction of the space.</li>
                        <img src="./Images/gridTemplateRepeat.png" alt="">
                        <li>grid-template-areas - when we define the items in the container grid with grid-area, we can give the main grid the property of grid-template area to do very complex of alignment of the items.Note, we do have to name every item to allow this to work, and we need each row needs the same number of cells/items per line if we don't add the dot notation, which means nothing.</li>
                        <img src="./Images/gridTemplateAreas.png" alt="">
                        <li>grid-gap - to create gaps, we will use column-gap or row-gap. Grid-column/row-gap will no longer be supported. For a shorthand, you can just use the word gap.</li>
                        <img src="./Images/gridGap.png" alt="">
                        <li>Left to right movement use justify items, align items top to bottom with align items, for both, use place-items. Align self works the same but with the effect of only one items. Place items is the shorthand for both in order of align then justify, just think top first then left and right.</li>

                        <li>In the event that your items don't fill your full container, like what happens when we use px, we will use justify-content and align content. Sometimes the total size of your grid might be less than the size of its grid container. This could happen if all of your grid items are sized with non-flexible units like px. For shorthand, use place-content.</li>
                        <img src="./Images/gridContainerContent.svg" alt="">
                        <li>Grid-auto-columns/rows - are used when we place an item that's not in our created grid layout. This essentially tell the grid to create these empty spaces with so it can fit in the right spot. Simply put, if we defined only 2 card in a row, and we add another card in the html, it will follow this rule. As you position some items, other items on the grid will continue to be laid out using the auto-placement rules. </li>

                <h3>Common Grid Items properties</h3>
                <p>
                <ul class="listMarginLeft__40px">
                    <li>
                        grid-column-start/end and grid-row-start/end - these can be a number, where they will start and end given the line, or you can use span and then a number and it will go expand over those grid tracks.
                    </li>
                    <img src="./Images/spanGrid.png" alt="">
                    <li>justify-self and align self - similar to justify content and align items but with only one item. Place-self sets both.</li>

                    <li>
                        Max and Min -
                        Both of these functions will return a value based on the arguments you supply them. min() will return the smallest of all the values passed in, and max() will return the largest. For example, min(100px, 200px) will return a value of 100px every time, while max(100px, 200px) will return a value of 200px every time.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        min-max - It is a relatively straightforward function that only takes in two arguments:
                        The minimum size the grid track can be
                        The maximum size the grid track can be. It allows rows and columns to only shrink so much. When using template repeat, we should be setting a min-max to avoid grid blowout. Unlike min() and max(), it can make sense to use static values for both arguments. Here is an example of the grid we’ve been using written with minmax() and some static values:
                    </li>

                <h3>Grid From Scratch</h3>
                <p>Grid has the power to make two dimensional layouts easy. If we have three items we want to control. Here we have 3 column numbers since each card in that column will be effective, if we changed the first number, the size of the two cards in that column will change. We have changed the first column number and both cards are now shorter.</p>

                    <ul class="listMarginLeft__40px">
                        <li>Grid Container - applies the display grid on.</li>

                <h3>Shorthand Grid Template</h3>
                <p>We can create a shorthand for both the rows and columns with simply calling grid-template. This image will give us 2 rows and 3 columns. </p>
                <img src="./Images/gridShort.png" alt="">
                <h3>Grid Gap</h3>
                <p>Gap was first made for grid before being move overed to flex as well. But grid also has the power to do column and row gaps, as well as both with just gap.</p>
                <h3>Grid-Template</h3>
                <p>Grid templates are creating the tracks for the grid, which we can remember it as creating the rows and columns. </p>
                <h3>Grid Lines</h3>
                <p>These are only created implicitly, meaning they are created when we create the tracks. </p>
                <h3>Position A Grid Display</h3>
                <p>We have a grid example below. One tool we can use will be the grid-column start and end. Grid-column start tells us where it starts and ends. Grid-column and Grid-Row are the shorthand rule of grid-column start and end which is seen under the kitchen section.</p>
                <div class="containerG">
                    <div class="room" id="living-room">Living Room</div>
                    <div class="room" id="kitchen">Kitchen</div>
                    <div class="room" id="bedroom">Bedroom</div>

                <h3>How to position a display Grid with Grid Area.</h3>
                <p>Grid area can be done in two ways. If we know the start and end for both rows and columns, we can treat grid area as a shorthand for all these. The other way will be to create grid template areas with names, and set the grid-area of the content as the name. We also have the option to use a dot to cover a space for an area we haven't named yet, the example below showcases grid-area with naming. grid-row-start grid-column-start grid-row-end grid-column-end</p>
                <img src="./Images/gridAreaShot.png" alt="">

                <h3>Stretching an item across the grid</h3>
                <p>Setting a grid-column of 1/-1 will set the grid item across the grid.</p>
                <h3>Default Spans, when we don't have to include ends.</h3>
                <p>Default spans
                    In practice if an item only spans one track you can omit the grid-column-end or grid-row-end value. Grid defaults to spanning one track.</p>

                    <h3>Responsive Grids</h3>
                    <p>The most basic way to make our grid items dynamic is by using fractional units, also known as fr. We can also create disproportionate grids by setting different fr repeats. </p>
                <img src="./Images/dispotFRGrid.png" alt="">
                <h3>Clamp</h3>
                <p>Clamp is not limited to grid, but is seen with it. Clamp is saying what is our ideal size, if it reaches that size, keep it that way unless it reaches the min or max values.</p>
                <img src="./Images/clampExample.png" alt="">
                <h3>Auto Fit and Auto Fill</h3>
                <p> You want to give your grid a number of columns that is flexible based on the size of the grid. For example, if our grid is only 200px wide, we may only want one column. If it’s 400px wide, we may want two, and so on. Solving this problem with media queries would be a lot of typing. Thankfully, auto-fit and auto-fill are here to save the day! It will prevent the items in the grid from overflowing. With minmax(), we can tell our grid that we want to have as many columns as possible, using the constraints of our minmax() function to determine each column’s size, without it overflowing our grid. Notice when we resize it, the items will change. </p>

                <h3>Explanation of Auto Fit</h3>
                <p>Auto fit will return the highest value. First it must know the width, either one we made or the width of the window. Next it sees how many columns can fit into that width, and this is done with the min value of the minmax, lets say it was 150px. If the width was 500px, it will create 3 columns. Once it decides how many to be done, the max value of min max, if it was 1fr, will make sure each one of the columns takes up 1fr of space.</p>
                <h3>Grid vs Flex</h3>
                <p>When to use what? When we think of which to use, we want to think of either content first or layout first.In Content First Design, you begin with clarity of how the content should be, and the layout follows. In Layout First Design, you decide how you want the pieces arranged, then fill in the content. Overall,Flexbox is essentially for laying out items in a single dimension – in a row OR a column. Grid is for layout of items in two dimensions – rows AND columns.</p>

                <h3>How to add multiple classes, ie, adding font awesome with JS</h3>
                <p>So, to add multiple classes, we want to store all classes as in array, and then use a spread operator to access them and then add them to whatever we want to add to.</p>
                <img src="./Images/addMultipleClassesWithJS.png" alt="">
                <h3>What is this?</h3>
                <p>The key to understanding this keyword is having a clear view of function invocation and how it impacts the context. this is the global object in a function invocation, ie, whenever a function is called, this comes along with it.</p>
                <h3>Object and Object constructors</h3>
                <p>One of the simplest ways you can begin to organize your code is by simply grouping things into objects. When you have a specific type of object that you need to duplicate like our player or inventory items, a better way to create them is using an object constructor, which is a function that looks like this:
                </p>

                <img src="./Images/newConstrucorJS.png" alt="">
                <img src="./Images/conFinalreusltJS.png" alt="">
                <h3>Prototypes</h3>
                <p>All objects in JavaScript have a prototype. Stated simply, the prototype is another object that the original object inherits from, which is to say, the original object has access to all of its prototype’s methods and properties. We can check proto with the example below, where player1 and 2 were made from the Player constructor, should return true. To create a prototype, instead of using a function inside a constructor, they advice to assign it as a prototype as seen below. 
                </p>
                <img src="./Images/checkProto.png" alt="">
                <img src="./Images/createProto.png" alt="">
                <h3>Legacy Code and Proto</h3>
                <p> .__proto__ is the same as getProto seen above. However, this is a non-standard way of doing so, and deprecated.In some places, like legacy code, you might also come across [[Prototype]], which is just another way of talking about the .__proto__ property of an object, like player1.[[Prototype]]. All in all, do not use these two.
                </p>
                <h3>Why focus on prototypes?</h3>
                <p>We can define properties and functions common among all objects on the prototype to save memory and the second reason is Prototypal Inheritance</p>
                <h3>How do we know something is inherited as a proto?</h3>
                <p>Some simple checks will be the hasOwnProperty method which checks whether or not something has been inherited or not.</p>
                <img src="./Images/hasOwnPropertyJS.png" alt="">
                <h3>Prototype Inheritance, SetProto</h3>
                <p>Every prototype object inherits from Object.prototype by default. Just as we use Object.getPrototypeOf() to ‘get’ or view the prototype of an object, we can use Object.setPrototypeOf() to ‘set’ or mutate it. From the code, we can see that we’ve defined a Person from whom a Player inherits properties and functions, and that the created Player objects are able to access both the .sayName and the .getMarker functions, in spite of them being defined on two separate prototype objects! This is enabled by the use of the Object.setPrototypeOf() function. It takes two arguments - the first is the one which inherits and the second argument is the one which you want the first argument to inherit from. </p>

                <h3>How to organize your JS code?</h3>
                <p>JS code can be organized in four different ways

                        <li>Plain Old JavaScript Objects and Object Constructors  - simple capital letter</li> 
                        <li>Factory Functions and the Module Pattern - No new keyword, you must return something, no this and no prototype inheritance</li>
                        
                        <li>Classes - uses class keyword, uses constructor keyword, uses this.</li>

                <h3>What is Intersection Observer</h3>
                <p>Intersection Observer is a powerful tool that allows on scroll effects without the need for it to be called each time a scroll is done. </p>
                <h3>How does Intersection work?</h3>
                <p>Most times, intersection observer can be used with query selector to select all elements or class names, or single elements and a class name. Just note that if you do select multiple elements and classes, the steps are slightly different. The callback and options are base template of the intersection, meaning we don't have to write the function within the observer.  </p>
                <img class="images" src="./Images/basicSkeletonIntObse.png" alt="">
                <img src="./Images/observerBareBone.png" alt="">
                <p>options hold three values; root, threshold, and margin
                    <ul class="listMarginLeft__40px">
                        <li>root - can be left out since most times root will be set to null, or just not written out at all. Both not writing anything for null and setting it to null will both set it to the viewport as seen in the skeleton example.</li>
                        <li>threshold - a 0 to 1 scale. By default 0. 0 is when any piece of the section is in view, while 1 is when 100% of the section is visible.</li>
                        <li>rootMargin - works like margins in CSS. If wanted, it must be in parenthesis and must be in either percentage or px base. Dictates when it's fired.</li>
                        <img class="images" src="./Images/basicSkeletonIntObseRootMargin.png" alt="">
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <h3>Intersection Observer with multiple classes</h3>
                <p>For multiple classes or elements, the structure is the same as a single class or element selection. The biggest difference is that at the end when you call the observer, you need to set the variable used to hold the list with a forEach as seen on line 7 of the image.</p>

                <p>A key thing to note that since we set the variable as colorChangeObserver instead of just observer, we must call colorChangeObserver to observer colorChange.</p>
                <h3>Prevent intersection Observer from firing all elements.</h3>
                <p>To prevent all selected elements from firing we will add an if statement to prevent this.What this also does is that when you leave the focus area, it won't fire again. Meaning that in our color change example, it would have stayed red as we passed by it. It would only fire again now when we re-enter the section, which in that case, will fire the toggle and remove the class, making it black again. The if statement is saying that if the area is <strong>NOT INTERSECTING</strong> then end the fire and don't remove the class.</p>
                <img src="./Images/intersectionObserverPreventAllFiring.png" alt="">
                <h3>To unobserve in intersection Observer</h3>
                <p>To unobserve something means that if we enter the section it will fire, but once we try to re-enter nothing will change. In the example of the color change, we will see that the color red will stay red once we pass it, and once we renter it, will stay red now.</p>
                <img src="./Images/unobserve.png" alt="">

                <h3>Fade in and out Effect with Intersection</h3>
                <p>For a simple fade in effect, use intersection observer and css transition, opacity, and transform.
                </p>

                <h3>TypeError...not an object</h3>
                <p>If you are getting this error, this is most likely due to the JS running before the element even exists on the page. Move the JS to the bottom of the webpage.</p>
                <h3>Reference error</h3>
                <p>A ReferenceError is thrown when one refers to a variable that is not declared and/or initialized within the current scope.</p>
                <h3>Syntax Error</h3>
                <p>A syntax error occurs when the code you are trying to run is not written correctly, i.e., in accordance with the grammatical rules of JavaScript.</p>
                <h3>Type Error</h3>
                <p>These errors are thrown for a few different reasons:Per MDN, a TypeError may be thrown when:an operand or argument passed to a function is incompatible with the type expected by that operator or function;or when attempting to modify a value that cannot be changed;or when attempting to use a value in an inappropriate way. Check to see if you are using the <strong>right type for the function</strong>  ie adding two strings with push can't be done since push only works with arrays, use concat instead.</p>
                <h3>TyperError Map is not a function</h3>
                <p>This could be Query Selector gets a nodeList not an array, to correct this use Array.from or spread, seen in map example.</p>
                <img src="./Images/NodeListintoArr.png" alt="">
                <h3>Type Error</h3>
                <p>guessSubmit.addeventListener is not a function, this error is seen because we have failed to capitalize the E in event, thus check to see if you spelled all the things correctly first.</p>
                <h3>How to Name Variables</h3>
                <p>If given the task to name a variable of our current planet what would we name it? While a variable of <kbd>'planet'</kbd>  may seem enticing, given a variable of <kbd>'ourPlanetName'</kbd>  while longer, it explains a couple of things:
                    <ul class="listMarginLeft__40px">
                        <li>Who's planet are we talking about?</li>
                        <li>And what about the planet is it storing?</li>
                        <li>It's almost always better to be verbose rather than ambiguous</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <h3>Const naming and use</h3>
                <p>Const is seen with hard values, but if it's calculated, we won't capitalize the full name, if it's a hard set value, then we would have it all capitalize. An example would be our birthday is a set date, so it would be all caps, but our age changes.</p>
                <h3>NaN error</h3>
                <p>Most likely cause by using a non number in arithmetic.The result will also be NaN if NaN is used, when trying to do math with (not including +) - , * , / , % ,etc.</p>
                <h3>Appending Text</h3>
                <p>When we want to add text to an element, we will use the JS append method, seen with the rounding example</p>
                <h3>Rounding Numbers</h3>
                <p>When wanting to round, you need to create another variable and set it  <kbd>.toFixed(2)</kbd> and example would be <span class="toBeFixed"></span> being fixed to <span class="fixed"></span></p>
                <img src="./Images/fixedJS.png" alt="">
                <h3>What is a string and how do we modify them?</h3>
                <p>If you are having issues with changing strings remember that strings are <strong>IMMUTABLE</strong> meaning that any change to a string must be done with creating a new variable and setting some sort of method to the string we want to change.</p>
                <h3>Turn a string into a number</h3>
                <p>if you are having issues having numbers concat instead of add, use <kbd>Number()</kbd> <span class="stringNumber"></span> the values should be  30, but it's not since it's adding it on like a string.</p>
                <img src="./Images/stringNumberJS.png" alt="">
                <h3>Turning a Number to a string</h3>
                <p>To turn a number into a string we will use the .toString method. However, if we wish to change an object into a string, we will use Jason.stringify since using toString won't work for arrays and objects (key value pairs). </p>
                <img src="./Images/NumberIntoStringJS.png" alt="">

                <h3>Using + to make strings into Numbers</h3>
                <p>Another option involves placing the + sign in front of string variables. Shorthand method of Numbers().</p>
                <img src="./Images/stringNumbersFasterJS.png" alt="">
                <h3>Using increment decrement</h3>
                <p>Using num++ or num-- will cause the value to retain the old value if never called after. Using ++num or --num will cause the value to change and be in use immediately.</p>
                <img src="./Images/increment:decrementJS.png" alt="">
                <h3>Backticks</h3>
                <p>Backticks are a version of quotes,"Backticks are “extended functionality” quotes. They allow us to embed variables and expressions into a string by wrapping them in ${…}, for example</p>
                <img src="./Images/backicksJS.png" alt="">
                <h3>Using prompt for Variable Definitions</h3>
                <p>When we want the user to enter a value,such as a temporary username, we can use the prompt function as a means to contain the value the user inputs. Also, by giving prompts a value after the statement we want responded to, we can create a default answer if the user ends up entering nothing.
                </p>
                <img src="./Images/promptUserVarJS.png" alt="">
                <img src="./Images/bracketVariables.png" alt="">
                <h3>More powers of backticks</h3>
                <p>Backticks have two other unique powers, if used inside the ${}, it can also be used for calculating a value, and if written on two separate lines, it will add the values on separate lines, similar to using \n</p>
                <img src="./Images/backTickMath.png" alt="">
                <h3>Extracting String Parts</h3>
                <p>There are three ways to extract a string, and assign it to another variable and the end is <strong>NEVER</strong> included.
                    <ul class="listMarginLeft__40px">
                        <li>Slice(start,end)</li>
                        <li>Substring(start,end)</li>
                        <li>substr(start,end)</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <h3>Slice (similar to substring)</h3>
                <p> Like all the extractions you need to assign the rest of the part to another variable.In this example, banana. If no end in inputting, it will just slice out the rest.</p>
                <img src="./Images/sliceJS.png" alt="">
                <h3>Substr()</h3>
                <p>Substr works at the start like slice, but the second value is a count from value, meaning using substr(7,6) means start at 7 and count up 6 spots instead of position based like in slice. Here we would get "BAN"</p>
                <img src="./Images/subStrJS.png" alt="">
                <h3>Making an array into a string</h3>
                <p>Combing an array can be achieved with the use of join, <span class="arrayNotJoined"></span> when joined will look like <span class="arrayJoined"></span></p>
                <img src="./Images/joinJS.png" alt="">
                <h3>Replace text with Regex</h3>
                <p>To replace words, we can use the replace method, note this returns a new string and only replaces one word unless we use regex.</p>
                <img src="./Images/replaceJS.png" alt="">
                <img src="./Images/replaceRegexJS.png" alt="">
                <h3>Pad start and Pad end</h3>
                <p>Used to add another string to current string, can add 0's or X's to the end of a current string, useful for hiding credit card numbers or social security number.This only works on strings, so if we have a number, we must first change it into a string as seen with the second image.</p>
                <img src="./Images/PadEnd.png" alt="">
                <img src="./Images/PadEndStringJS.png" alt="">
                <h3>Split,making a string into an array</h3>
                <p>The strength of split is that it now allows us to manipulate a string like array.Note, split is the only one of the three S's, split, slice, and splice, that works for strings.</p>
                <img src="./Images/SplitJS.png" alt="">
                <h3>complete list of all string Methods</h3>

                </p>
                <h3>Power of === </h3>
                <p>A strick equality sign will first test types, meaning that if a string and a number are compared, it won't change the string into a number as seen with ==, and will instead immediately return false</p>
                <h3>Writing Else Statements</h3>
                <p>Else statements should always come at the end, since they are always run when all other conditions have failed to be met.</p>
                <img src="./Images/elseStatmentJS.png" alt="">
                <h3>Or Operator</h3>
                <p>The OR operator finds the first truthy value.Most of the time, OR || is used in an if statement to test if any of the given conditions is true.If all are false, then the last operand will be returned.This effect can also be used for a short circuit effect, meaning that a function can be called if all the operands to the left are false.</p>
                <img src="./Images/ORJS.png" alt="">
                <img src="./Images/ORAllFalseJS.png" alt="">

                <img src="./Images/ANDJS.png" alt="">
                <h3>Nesting vs using operators</h3>
                <p>We can achieve some nested code by replace them with logical operators && and ||</p>

                <h3>Checking Var once</h3>
                <p>A common issue when using && and || is when choosing a variable, it must be called upon each time.</p>
                <img src="./Images/operatorsPitfall.png" alt="">
                <h3>Switch Statement</h3>
                <p>
                    Switch statements can be used for checking one value at at time, but can also be used for many variables before a break, for an extensive list, follow this link <a target="_blank" href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-the-switch-statement-in-javascript">Digital Ocean</a>

                <h3>Ternary Operators and HTML color theme</h3>
                <p>When lots of if statements clog up the code, we can try to shorten it with ternary operators that tries to answer basic true of false statements.

                <h3>How to edit CSS with JS</h3>
                <p>There are two ways to edit but both require the style phrase. 
                    <ol class="listMarginLeft__40px">

                <h3>Smooth Scroll away effect</h3>
                <p>When wanting to cause things to vanish from the site, it's better to look into <kbd>transform:translate3d(xpx,ypx,zpx)</kbd> where z is most likely going to be 0px, and then applying a transition on the main class.

                <h3>Local Storage and Changing Document Title</h3>
                <p>Local storage can only store strings. For local storage and retrieval, we use the window local storage of getItem and setItem.Once we have this, we can create an if statement to see if a stored item is present or not. It uses the first value as the key, like a variable, and the second variable will be the value of that variable, technically these are key objects pairs.Note, we didn't use the setItem of 'userName' variable since we didn't want to call the getItem local storage at this point.</p>
                <img src="./Images/localStorangeOnClick.png" alt="">
                <h3>Local storage and objects</h3>
                <p>Objects by themselves can't be stored with setItem, you will just get returned Object object. To get around this, we will serialized, convert it to some readable data which we will use Json. stringify the object. Now with getItems, we will change the string back into an object with JSON.parse.</p>
                <img src="./Images/serliazedObject.png" alt="">
                <h3>Scroll Height vs offset Height vs Client Height</h3>
                <p>When wanting on scroll effect outside of intersection observer, we will use both the scroll height: amount seen in window, clientHeight: the height of an element + the vertical padding. offsetHeight: the height of the element + the vertical padding + the top and bottom borders + the horizontal scrollbar (if it's available).</p>

                <h3>Rewriting variables with local scope</h3>
                <p>Setting a variable with let will only allow change to the outside if we set the variable to another variable without the let phrase. If we do decide to give the variable a new value, but use let, it <strong>WON'T</strong> change the value of the global variable.

                <h3>Argument Vs parameter</h3>
                <p>Parameters are the variables we put inside th parenthesis of functions.Arguments are the values we use for the functions. </p>
                <h3>Function Naming conventions</h3>
                <p>Functions are actions. So their name is usually a verb. It should be brief, as accurate as possible and describe what the function does, so that someone reading the code gets an indication of what the function does. It is a widespread practice to start a function with a verbal prefix which vaguely describes the action. There must be an agreement within the team on the meaning of the prefixes. For instance, functions that start with "show" usually show something. Function starting with… "get…"- return a value, "calc…" - calculate something, "create…" - create something, "check…" - check something and return a boolean, etc. Examples of such names:</p>
                <img src="./Images/examplesOfFunctionNames.png" alt="">
                <h3>When to use declaration vs function expression?</h3>
                <p>When to choose Function Declaration versus Function Expression?
                    As a rule of thumb, when we need to declare a function, the first thing to consider is Function Declaration syntax. It gives more freedom in how to organize our code, because we can call such functions before they are declared.
                    That's also better for readability, as it's easier to look up function f(…) {…} in the code than let f = function(…) {…};. Function Declarations are more “eye-catching”.
                    …But if a Function Declaration does not suit us for some reason, or we need a conditional declaration. Another note, function expressions can only work if placed first, while declarations can work any time, but only within the scope of the function if it was made in one.</p>

                        <li>Understand the problem: Explain the problem in plain english, write it down and draw diagrams if useful.</li>
                        <li>Plan:What inputs does the program have?Where is the data? What's the desired output? And given your inputs, what are the steps to get the desired output? This last question is where the code begins.Great place to use comments in JS code.</li>
                        <li>Pseudocode: Write out the plan of attack in plain english first. An example of this will be if we are trying to print out inputted numbers. 
                            <p>"When the user inputs a number
                            Initialize a counter variable and set its value to zero.
                            While counter is smaller than user inputted number increment the counter by one.
                            Print the value of the counter variable."</p>  </li>
                        <li>Decomposition: Decomposition is the main way to deal with complexity.Work on the subproblem first, trying to make one function for the whole thing makes issues and knots later one. </li>

                    <h3>FizzBuzz</h3>
                    <p>"Write a program that takes a user's input and prints the numbers from one to the number the user entered. However, for multiples of three print Fizz instead of the number and for the multiples of five print Buzz. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print FizzBuzz."
                        <ol class="listMarginLeft__40px">
                            <li> Understand: Write a program that allows the user to enter a number, print each number between one and the number the user entered, but for numbers that divide by three without a remainder print Fizz instead. For numbers that divide by 5 without a remainder print Buzz and finally for numbers that divide by both three and five without a remainder print FizzBuzz.</li>
                            <li>Plan: Does your program have an interface? What will it look like? Our FizzBuzz solution will be a browser console program, so we don't need an interface. The only user interaction will be allowing users to enter a number.
                            What inputs will your program have? Will the user enter data or will you get input from somewhere else? The user will enter a number from a prompt (popup box).
                            What's the desired output? The desired output is a list of numbers from 1 to the number the user entered. But each number that is divisible by 3 will output Fizz, each number that is divisible by 5 will output Buzz and each number that is divisible by both 3 and 5 will output FizzBuzz.
                            Given your inputs, what are the steps necessary to return the desired output?</li>
                            <li>Pseudocode: 
                                When a user inputs a number
                                Loop from 1 to the entered number
                                If the current number is divisible by 3 then print "Fizz"
                                If the current number is divisible by 5 then print "Buzz"
                                If the current number is divisible by 3 and 5 then print "FizzBuzz"
                                Otherwise print the current number</li>
                            <li> Decomposition:As we can see from the algorithm we developed, the first subproblem we can solve is getting input from the user. So let's start there and verify it works by printing the entered number. Next loop from 1 to the enter number. Next if it can be divided by 3 then print fizz. etc. For the rest of the explanation go to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-problem-solving"> The Odin Project</a></li>

                    <h3>Cannot read property 'style' of Undefined in JS</h3>
                    <p>This mostly occurs when using an array and you make the for loop go to far. The fix to this is simply make it so that it's just less not less than or equal to. So remove the = and it'll now work without errors.</p>

                    <h3>Selecting all classes</h3>
                    <p>When working with multiple classes, you have to create a for loop when creating your changes after an event listener, otherwise JS will shoot an error.</p>

                    <h3>Value of Text</h3>
                    <p>To get the value of text, we will use text.value</p>
                    <img src="./Images/textValueJS.png" alt="">
                    <h3>Array declare</h3>
                    <p>Most arrays are declared with const instead of let or var</p>
                    <h3>Arrays, when to use [] vs {}</h3>
                    <p>[] are full lists of things without needing to call the name. {} is for when we call the name to get the member. You should use objects , {},when you want the element names to be strings (text).You should use arrays, [],when you want the element names to be numbers.</p>

                    <h3>Arrays with forEach and for loops</h3>
                    <p>A forEach does the <strong>SAME</strong> thing as a for loop.</p>

                    <h3>Adding elements to arrays, .push()</h3>
                    <p>To add an element to the end of an array, use push</p>
                    <img src="./Images/pushJS.png" alt="">
                    <h3>Convert an array into a string</h3>
                    <p>Sometimes we want to manipulate an array as a string, use toString().</p>
                    <img src="./Images/toStringJS.png" alt="">
                    <h3>Tips on Push and Pop</h3>
                    <p>We push things in and pop things about, but both need the array to either be called again or assigned to the variable.</p>
                    <h3>Shift and unshift</h3>
                    <p>Works at the start of array, removes the first element and shifts all elements to the lower index.</p>
                    <h3>Merging two arrays into a new array with concat</h3>
                    <p>Concat always creates a new array, it does not modify the arrays that are going to be concat</p>

                    <h3>Splice</h3>
                    <p>The splice() method adds new items to an array.e first parameter (2) defines the position where new elements should be added (spliced in).The second parameter (0) defines how many elements should be removed.The rest of the parameters ("Lemon" , "Kiwi") define the new elements to be added.</p>

                    <h3>Slice</h3>
                    <p>Slice method does not modify an old array, it creates a new one.If the other value is added it will go up to but not count that value. If no value is added for the second one, then it will slice the whole thing.</p>

                    <h3>For Of Loops</h3>
                    <p>Looping through a collection. The function says pretty much get the collection. And assign it to a variable of your choice. Then get that variable and run it through the curly brackets.</p>

                    <h3>Map Array</h3>
                    <p>Take a collection and create change to each item in the collection.This example uses a function as the change we want to make to each item in the collection. Map changed the whole world.</p>
                    <img src="./Images/MapArray.png" alt="">
                    <h3>Filter Array</h3>

                    <h3>Function Expressions Arrays</h3>
                    <p>Filters and Map both typically use function expression typically to become more compact.</p>

                    <h3>Looping through a Contact to find a number</h3>
                    <p>This example uses for of, but try to make it using only for loops with i values since they can interchange, or should. Note, the use of input.value and focus being set to nothing is to allow the function to get ready for the next user input.</p>

                    <h3>While do loops</h3>
                    <p>While stars the Initialize, while holds the condition, code to run, and then the final expression.</p>

                    <h3>Do While loops</h3>
                    <p>Similar to the while loop, the main difference between a do...while loop and a while loop is that the code inside a do...while loop is always executed at least once. </p>

                    <h3>For of Loop with slice and array</h3>
                    <p>Array with slice, remember that slice needs a new variable, but it can be the same, also, when adding onto a list, it can be easier to use += instead of pushing. Most time we don't want to push if we want to make a string.</p>
                    <h3>Break</h3>
                    <p>A break does not rely on waiting for a false statement, if it meets the criteria the function ends.Does not work on ternary operators.</p>
                    <img src="./Images/breakExample.png" alt="">
                    <h3>Continue</h3>
                    <p>Based on the evaluation, if it passed, the function keeps on going but it throws the passed evaluation away. Does not work on ternary operators.</p>
                    <img src="./Images/continueExample.png" alt="">
                    <h3>Test Driven Development</h3>
                    <p>The process of writing automated tests that describe how your code should work before you actually write the code. The test will fail before you write your code, and you should be able to know that your code works correctly when the test passes.</p>
                    <h3>TDD example with Hello World</h3>
                    <p>First, a new JS file should be named, with the included phrase of (fileName).spec.js. At the very top of the file we use `require()` to import the code from the javascript file (`helloWorld.js`) so that we can test it.Describe is the body of the test.Test is us explaining in plain english what should happen, and then expect inside that function says that the imported file to equal what it should equal, this sometimes aligns with the plain english portion if it's a string. To run the tests we will then test it with running it in the terminal in npm format. We will include the export portion on the regular JS file to allow us to import it in the spec file.</p>

                    <h3>Filter and includes</h3>
                    <p>When considering arrays, always think of the big three, map,filter, and reduce if you want some sort of modification to an array.</p>
                    <img src="./Images/filter&Includes.png" alt="">
                    <h3>Spread Operator</h3>
                    <p>Spread operator allows an iterable to expand in places where 0+ arguments are expected. Best when an unknown amount of arguments (multiple) are going to be included.</p>

                    <h3>Math.floor and Math.random</h3>
                    <p>While wanting rounded numbers, floor allows us to get an equal distribution of random numbers within a range. However, Math.round is better suited if we want just a rounded number for math purposes or when choosing to make a number more readable to humans.  </p>

                    <h3>Round to Decimal</h3>
                    <p>When rounding to a desired decimal we can use toFixed, however this makes it into a string, to change into a number you can use Number or + before the variable.</p>

                    <h3>What is the DOM?</h3>
                    <p>DOM stands for Document Object Model, which is a tree like representation of the contents of the page. This is how we classify elements as parents, children, or siblings.</p>

                    <h3>What are some issues with querySelectorAll?</h3>
                    <p>SelectAll looks like an array, but is actually a nodeList, meaning not all array methods work. One solution is it use the spread operator on the nodeList.</p>
                    <h3>How do you create an Element?</h3>
                    <p><code>const div = document.createElement('div');
                    </code> <strong>NOTE: This does NOT put the element in the DOM, it stores it in memory so it can be manipulated first with styles,classes,etc.</strong></p>
                    <h3>Editing Attributes</h3>
                    <p>Most attributes can be found or edited with (desire)Attribute</p>
                    <img src="./Images/attributesJS.png" alt="">
                    <h3>Adding,remove, or toggle classes</h3>
                    <p>While we can add classes with div.classList.add and remove them with div.classList.remove, it's almost always better to toggle it instead with div.classList.toggle.</p>
                    <h3>textContent vs innerHTML</h3>
                    <p>It's almost always better to add textContent rather than use innerHTML since this prevents accidental leakage of data.</p>
                    <h3>How to append an element into another element</h3>
                    <p>Appending an element first requires us to  create the element, and then create add the modifications we want before appending it to where we want.</p>
                    <img src="./Images/appendContent.png" alt="">
                    <h3>Adding Inline styles</h3>
                    <p>Here are all the examples of how we can add CSS styles to an element.</p>
                    <img src="./Images/cssStyles.png" alt="">
                    <h3>Append vs AppendChild</h3>
                    <p>In situations were we don't care for the return value, we can use append in most cases over appendChild. AppendChild does not work if we just want to append text.</p>
                    <h3>Attach listeners to a group of Nodes</h3>
                    <p>We learned above that we can get a nodelist of all of the items matching a specific selector with querySelectorAll('selector'). In order to add a listener to each of them we simply need to iterate through the whole list.</p>

                    <h3>How to Clear content</h3>
                    <p>The easiest way to clear content with  be to use <code>(container).innerHTML = ""</code>However using innerHTML cause cause leaks of data and hackers to ruin the site. A newer approach is to use <code>(container).replaceChildren();
                    </code>This method allows us to clear the children and if wanted, replace it with new children. However if the goal is simply to clear the children,leave it blank.</p>
                    <h3>What are Objects?</h3>
                    <p>Objects are used to store keyed collections of various data and more complex entities.An object can be created with figure brackets {…} with an optional list of properties. A property is a “key: value” pair, where key is a string (also called a “property name”), and value can be anything.(taken from <a href="https://javascript.info/object" target="_blank"> javascript.info</a> ) </p>
                    <h3>What are the two ways we can created objects?</h3>
                    <p>We can create objects with an object literal or an object constructor syntax</p>
                    <img src="./Images/CreateObjectsJS.png" alt="">
                    <h3>When you think of objects what should you think of first? </h3>
                    <p>Key: value pairs, all objects follow this. And a key: value pair together are called properties. </p>
                    <h3>How to delete properties</h3>
                    <p> <code>delete object:key, ie delete user.age</code></p>
                    <img src="./Images/objectWithKeyValue.png" alt="">
                    <h3>Keeping objects consistent</h3>
                    <p>When having two or more words values with a key, they must be in quotations. Also, when creating keys: value pairs, they are ended with a comma, including the last one. This is called a trailing comma.</p>
                    <img src="/Images/consistentObjects.png" alt="">
                    <h3>Square bracket notation</h3>
                    <p>If wanting to access a value that's greater than one word, we <strong>MUST</strong>use square bracket notation. Remember that the bracket still needs quotation marks.</p>
                    <img src="./Images/squareBracket.png" alt="">
                    <h3>Bracket Notation Variables</h3>
                    <p>Since dot notation cannot take variables, we must use bracket notation if we are defining a variable.</p>

                    <h3>Computer properties</h3>
                    <p>When property names are simple we want to use dot notation, but if we need something more complex, we will use bracket notation.</p>

                    <h3>Why do some key value pairs have the same name?</h3>
                    <p> Properties have the same names as variables. The use-case of making a property from a variable is so common, that there's a special property value shorthand to make it shorter.</p>

                    <h3>For in Loop, checking all keys or values.</h3>
                    <p>When we want to check all keys in objects, we can use a for in loop.</p>

                    <h3>Objects with more than one value and values as functions</h3>
                    <p>Another neat thing with properties is the ability to create more than one value per key, and the ability to create a value that acts as a function. Note, that if the function method is created, you must call the function similar to how you call a key:value pair with dot notation.</p>
                    <img src="./Images/objectsWithValuesAndFun.png" alt="">
                    <h3>Object Methods</h3>
                    <p>Similar to properties, a key with a function is called a method as seen with the bio function above. However, a shorter syntax will be to exclude the function phrase, as seen with introduceSelf().</p>
                    <img src="./Images/objectMethod.png" alt="">
                    <h3>Object as object properties</h3>
                    <p>Given a property, we can create another property within to subclass items. Ie we can have a property. And to access them as dot notation is just to extend it <code>person.name.first</code> while bracket notation will be <code>person['name']['first']
                    </code></p>

                    <h3>How to create new members outside of the objects.</h3>
                    <p>To create new members is to use dot notation or bracket notation and create it outside. </p>
                    <img src="./Images/objectsCreations.png" alt="">
                    <h3>Dynamically creating objects</h3>
                    <p>Creating objects can also be done with variables and having stored key values pairs as variables.</p>
                    <img src="/Images/dynamCreation.png" alt="">
                    <h3>What is this in Objects</h3>
                    <p>This always refers to the object. So in person it will refer to person.</p>
                    <h3>Creating constructors</h3>
                    <p>To create objects and then return those objects, note that they are functions at heart. The naming of constructors should start with a capital letter and named for the type of object it will create. First, the function (constructor) will be created. After creating the function, it will act as a constructor only when called upon with the word new. Also, when calling multiple keys, add the values you want one after the other, but remember that you will call the variable assigned to the new constructors not the values.</p>

                    <h3>Array Methods</h3>
                    <p>Filter, map, sort, and reduce are the gateway drug to functional programming.</p>
                    <h3>Filter</h3>
                    <p>Filter will always reduce the amount</p>
                    <img src="./Images/filterArr.png" alt="">

                    <h3>Map</h3>
                    <p>Map will always give the same amount of numbers back, but changes it or only shows part of what you want.</p>
                    <img src="./Images/mapArrShort.png" alt="">
                    <h3>Sort</h3>
                    <p>You get two items and you compare just the two. If person A is bigger than person B, then move that on top, and this is done with 1 and -1. Another note, it <strong>MUST</strong> be returned otherwise it will not work.</p>
                    <img src="./Images/soryArr.png" alt="">
                    <h3>Reduce</h3>
                    <p>Allows you to build over each one. Like sort, it must return something. Also, reduce has so far always either had a black with {} or a value of 0 at the end. Note, the first arg is usually what running total, or what ypu have returned last time.</p>
                    <img src="./Images/reduceArr.png" alt="">

                    <h3>Sort by oldest with variables</h3>
                    <p>With sort we use A and B, but we can also use A and B to find the key of the items we are sorting.</p>

                    <h3>How to make a nodeList into an array?</h3>

                    <h3>If on a site, what should we do to get all words that have x letters in it?</h3>
                    <p>First we need to get the dev tools open and see what contains the word we want to look at, a special class or id. Next we want all the links.</p>
                    <img src="./Images/allTheDe.png" alt="">
                    <h3>Sorting by last name</h3>
                    <p>Sometimes we need to create conversions to use the data as seen in this example.</p>
                    <img src="./Images/sortByLastName.png" alt="">
                    <h3>Creating objects if not present, and with keys we aren't sure exist.</h3>
                    <p>Sometimes we have data with no clear properties. In this case, if we use methods we should create a blank object to start.</p>
                    <img src="./Images/creatingObjectsAndCountingUp.png" alt="">
                    <h3>.Some, at least one is true.</h3>
                    <p>Some checks to see if at least one is true. It also uses the current year to find the age.</p>
                    <img src="./Images/some.png" alt="">
                    <h3>Get the Current Year</h3>
                    <p>To get the current year, use the new Date and then getFullYear.</p>
                    <h3>Every</h3>
                    <p>Every works the same as some, the only difference is the use of every instead of some.</p>
                    <img src="./Images/everyMethod.png" alt="">
                    <h3>Find</h3>
                    <p>Find is like filter, but instead returns just the one you are looking for</p>
                    <img src="./Images/find.png" alt="">
                    <h3>FindIndex and delete a line</h3>
                    <p>Find index can be used when we want to delete something from our arrays since we need to know the position of them.</p>
                    <img src="./Images/findIndex.png" alt="">
                    <h3>Recursion</h3>
                    <p>Similar to reduce, whenever we have a value we want to manipulate with a previous value, we can consider recursion. Note, we must set a base statement so it doesn't go forever, typically returning a value of 1.</p>
                    <img src="./Images/recursion.png" alt="">
                    <h3>Palindromes</h3>
                <p>In this problem, we use the power of regex to remove all commas and non letter and replace it with nothing. We then change the string into an array to allow us to reverse it and then join them together to allow comparison of the word and the reverse version of the word.Lastly, we made all letters lowercase.</p>

                <img src="./Images/fibonacci.png" alt="">
                <h3>Find The Oldest</h3>
                <p>In this instance we wanted to first check if a death date were present, if not, we checked it with the simple if it's true statement at the top. Then we just created and age property that is then sorted to find the largest number. We then used the find method to recalculate the ages again but this time compare them to the largest value in sort, and it match, it returns the person even if currently alive.</p>
                <img src="./Images/findTheOldest.png" alt="">
                <h3>Functions within functions with both having parameters</h3>
                <p>If we have a function within a function, we can remedy this by setting the overall function with  variable and then using that variable to call the internal function. </p>
                <img src="./Images/functionInFunctionPara.png" alt="">
                <h3>Constructors issues</h3>
                <p>In regards to constructors, why are they not liked? They are not liked because they look like regular javascript, but if you miss the new keyword, not only does your program fail to work, but it also produces error messages that are hard to track down and understand.</p>
                <h3>What is a closure?</h3>
                <p>A closure refers to the combination of a function and the surrounding state within which a function was declared in. This surrounding state, also called its lexical environment, consists of any local variables that were in scope at the time the closure was made. In short, if a function is assigned to a variable and then called upon as the variable, it retains all the variables that were included in the function, in function scope. </p>
                <h3>What are factory functions?</h3>
                <p>Similar to constructors but they use the power of closures. Instead of using the new keyword to create an object, factory functions simply set up and return the new object when you call the function. The largest difference I can tell, is that it returns something.</p>
                <h3>What is a minor issue with factory</h3>
                <p>They do not use the prototype, which incurs a performance penalty - but as a general rule, this penalty isn't significant unless you're creating thousands of objects.</p>
                <img src="./Images/consturAndFact.png" alt="">
                <h3>Destructure</h3>
                <p>When you have an object or an array, you can extract a property of an object into a variable of the same name, or any named variable for an array. </p>
                <img src="./Images/destructure .png" alt="">
                <h3>Object shorthand notation</h3>
                <p>Object shorthand is when the variable we assign matches with the object's name.  IE if we have a variable called name = "fred" and we want to assign it to an object, called named, instead of writing object = {name:name} we can just do object = {name}</p>
                <h3>Private variables and functions</h3>
                <p>With factory functions we can also create private variables, since the return variables do not container the variable itself of reputation. it's defined as a private variable since we cannot access the variable directly in the object instance. </p>
                <img src="./Images/privateVariablesFactory .png" alt="">
                <h3>Factory Inheritance</h3>
                <p>We can do something similar to prototype inheritance with factory functions. You can simply create your User, extract what you need from it, and re-return whatever you want to</p>
                <img src="./Images/factoryInheritance.png" alt="">
                <h3>immediate Invoked Function expression</h3>
                <p>Oftentimes, you do not need a factory to produce multiple objects - instead, you are using it to wrap sections of code together, hiding the variables and functions that you do not need elsewhere as private. This is easily achievable by wrapping your factory function in parentheses and immediately calling (invoking) it. This immediate function call is commonly referred to as an Immediately Invoked Function Expression (duh) or IIFE in short. This pattern of wrapping a factory function inside an IIFE is called the module pattern. Take note of the () at the end of the function, and how the whole function is wrapped.</p>
                <img src="./Images/IIFE.png" alt="">
                <h3>Benefits of IIFE</h3>
                <p>IIFE allows us to encapsulate our code (bundle into a single unit) and in turn also leads into the effect of namespacing. Namespacing is a technique that is used to avoid naming collisions in our programs.  </p>
                <h3>Revist to closures</h3>
                <p>A closure is the ability to access a parent level scope from a child scope, even after the parent function has been terminated. One way this is seen is when functions are inside another function, and there are two ways we can return it. However, if we do it the second way, we have to create another variable an assign it to the outer function, and this variable will be the new variable to invoke the inner function.</p>

                <h3>Private Variables with practical use</h3>
                <p>Private variables can't be access, in an example of creating games, it will allow us to run multiple different types of games.Even though the score variable is the same variable name, because we have created two separate win() functions by using the createGame() function, they each have their own private variable score. </p>

                <h3>What is a module? </h3>
                <p>Module is created as an IIFE (immediately invoked function expression) with a function inside <code>const SomeModule = (function() {})();
                </code></p>
                <h3>Some ground rules of modules</h3>
                <p>Little (~1) global variables should be present in a code base, global variables will slow a large program down. Also dry code is important, one example of this, we should not be searching the DOM too much, we should be using DOM cache in these cases. No memory leaks, common causes of memory leaks will be most event listeners, to prevent these, they need to be unbound.</p>
                <h3>What are some common ways to cache your Doms?</h3>
                <p>Set it into a module, and then reference the DOM once in a Method, and from that Method, we can get the other elements.</p>

                <p>Render is a common phrase on modular JS where lets get the current state of the module and translate it to JS</p>
                <h3>Organize your code with modules</h3>
                <p>Modules lets us organize our code by creating object methods and naming the methods as what they do. In this image, we understand that init runs all the methods, cacheDom holds all are DOM selections and render handles all the HTML input</p>

                <h3>Binding events gotcha</h3>
                <p>When we bind events, the event is set to what the event was bound to. In this example, this.button will be the value to this.people. To correct this, we can bind the event so it's this.addPerson.bind(this) </p>

                <h3>IIFE how does it execute?</h3>
                <p>When we do an IIFE we are placing it within paranthesis, when we do this, it causes JS to evaluate it first and then treat it as the evaluting thing. Such as var people = (function(){})()</p>
                <h3>Privite coventions</h3>
                <p>If we are performing IIFE, it is standard convetins to set an underscore before the variable name. IE function _render(){}</p>
                <h3>Pubsub or Mediator</h3>
                <p>If something changes, what are the downroad effects of this change, how many other things will change as a result of one change. </p>
                <h3>Classes</h3>
                <p>JS does not have classes like other Object Orientated Languages.Since we’ve already gone fairly in-depth with Constructors, you don’t have too much left to learn here beyond the new syntax. If you choose to use classes in your code (that’s fine!) you can use them much the same way as object constructors.</p>
                <h3>Object properties</h3>
                <p>There are two types of object properties. Data and accessor</p>
                <h3>Accessor properties</h3>
                <p>They are essentially functions that execute on getting and setting a value, but look like regular properties to an external code. Accessor properties are represented by “getter” and “setter” methods. In an object literal they are denoted by get and set:</p>
                <h3>Getters</h3>
                <p>Makes a method look like a property, we will write it the same as a method function, but simply add get in front of the method, and then call like any normal property.Getters works very similary to calling a function that was created within an object. From the outside, an accessor property (getter in this instance) looks like a regular one. That’s the idea of accessor properties. We don’t call user.fullName as a function, we read it normally: the getter runs behind the scenes. </p>
                <img src="./Images/getterJS.png" alt="">
                <h3>Why use getters?</h3>
                <p>Can be used to run logic anytime we access a property, IE, a counter increase.</p>
                <h3>Setters</h3>
                <p>Setters are basically if we want to manually add into the objects, IE overdide something as if it was a normal object. They are also used for throwing errors if lets say a name is short or empty. </p>
                <img src="./Images/settingJS.png" alt="">
                <h3>Basic classes syntax</h3>
                <p>The basic flow will be you declare your class, and within that class, you will have a constructor with methods.</p>
                <img src="./Images/classSyntax.png" alt="">
                <h3>Calling classes</h3>
                <p>When we call the class with the new phrase, the constructor is automatically called. And two things happen,A new object is created, and the constructor runs with the given argument and assigns it to this.name. Also to note, unlike factory functions, we don't place commas between the classes, this will cause a syntax issue.</p>
                <h3>What is a class?</h3>
                <p>Classes are a template for creating objects. They encapsulate data with code to work on that data. Classes in JS are built on prototypes but also have some syntax and semantics that are unique to classes. Some people argue that it's mostly “syntactic sugar” (syntax that is designed to make things easier to read, but doesn’t introduce anything new), </p>
                <h3>Losing this</h3>
                <p>A term coined to describe when an object method is passed around and called in another context, this won’t be a reference to its object any more.</p>
                <h3>Solutions to losing this.</h3>
                <p>1. Pass a wrapper-function, such as setTimeout(() => button.click(), 1000). Or 2. Bind the method to object, e.g. in the constructor</p>
                <h3>class expression or a class declaration.</h3>
                <p>Classes can be expressed in two ways, either we set it up similarly to a function, or we can set it up more like assigning a variable and are always executed in strict mode.</p>
                <img src="./Images/defineClass.png" alt="">
                <h3>Class constructors</h3>
                <p>The constructor method is a special method for creating and initializing an object created with a class. There can only be one special method with the name "constructor" in a class. This is the part where we mostly see this being used.</p>
                <img src="./Images/constructorEx.png" alt="">
                <h3>What do methods do in classes?</h3>
                <p>Methods control the actual work, taking in the objects created in the constructor and using these values in meaningful ways.</p>
                <h3>What are static keywords used for?</h3>
                <p>They are used on classes for fixed, non altering data. Static keywords belong to the class, rather than the objects created from the classes If we wish to call them, we call the class.</p>

                <h3>Extends with classes</h3>
                <p>Used when a generic class when we want to make a child class by keeping the same features, and a little extra.The extends keyword is used in class declarations or class expressions to create a class as a child of another constructor (either a class or a function).If there is a constructor present in the subclass, it needs to first call super() before using this. The super keyword can also be used to call corresponding methods of super class. The child has access to the properties, but we still need to call the parent constructor, but we can do it in a more generic way by using super. Calls the logic of the parent class. </p>

                <h3>Use of Classes</h3>
                <p>Here we can use this to create an arrat of our classes, then create a functin to loop through the array with for in to show who is coding.</p>
                <img src="./Images/useOfClasses.png" alt="">
                <img src="./Images/useOfClasses2.png" alt="">
                <h3>Why use classes?</h3>
                <p>Classes help with static keywords, inheritance, and encapsulation.</p>
                <h3>Function inside classes</h3>
                <p>Within classes, we do not need to use function keywords.</p>
                <h3>Private properties with classes</h3>
                <p>Can't be used outside the class, and uses the #symbol. The biggest thing is encapsulation, where we can't call the variable directly, but instead, call a method which uses the variable.</p>
                <img src="./Images/privateClassesVar.png" alt="">
                <h3>Static methods with classes, </h3>
                <p>Other methods are instance methods, each time we invoke the class, ie player1 = new Class, everyime we use the new keyword, all of those properties belongs to that paricular instance. If we want to create a method that belong to the class, we can use static methods. To use, we will use the static keyword before creating a method. The only way to see species, is if we call Person.species(). If we use this, it won't point to the instance, it will point to the class.</p>
                <img src="./Images/staticMethod.png" alt="">
                <h3>Static properties</h3>
                <p>Seen in react, setting as a simple species = "homo sap" does not work, they typically use babel to get around this, a JS compiler.</p>
                <h3>The good of classes</h3>
                <p>So making the syntax look better and similar to other OO languages, while still keeping the “prototype” inheritance goodness is a good thing. People can use other ways if they don’t want to use “Class” to create Objects.</p>
                <h3>What makes classes bad?</h3>
                <p>Objects are created without Classes, there is no DNA, or blueprint needed.Concept of classes makes things brittle.Further “prototype”-chain based inheritance can wire up any object to any other object that may not be related.It also guides people away from goodness and power of functional programming.</p>
                <h3>Inheritance and composition</h3>
                <p>Given this though experiment, if we have a murder robot dog, what would we do if we have a robot and animal class already? It can do some of both, but not all of animal, it doesn't poop.</p>
                <img src="./Images/murderRobotDog.png" alt="">
                <h3>Inheritance</h3>
                <p>We decide what to give based off what they are.</p>
                <h3>Composition</h3>
                <p>composition is better since it decides what they do.</p>
                <img src="./Images/compositionWorkFlow.png" alt="">
                <img src="./Images/startOfCompo.png" alt="">
                <h3>Object assign and composition</h3>
                <p>Object assign does, it takes an object, and assigns the properties of the other objects into it.</p>
                <h3>ES6 Modules History</h3>
                <p>Making a webpage at first was just to add JS with a script in the index. Then we started to add libraries by downloading them and adding them before the js script. Note that moment.min.js (a library) gets loaded before index.js, which means you can use the moment function in index.js. The bad thing was that it was annoying to find and download new versions of libraries every time they would update. As a result, javaScript package managers emerged to help automate the process of downloading and upgrading libraries from a central repository with npms getting popular.
                </p>
                <h3>How to use npm to manually install libraries.</h3>
                <p>NPM if you have node.js installed, you already have npm installed, which means you can navigate your command line to the folder with your index.html file and enter: <code>npm init</code>after npm init, we get a package.json file. This is a configuration file that npm uses to save all project information. From the library we want, we can now follow their instructions, for this tutorial it will be <code>$ npm install moment --save</code>
                </p>
                <h3>What happens when you use npm install?</h3>
                <p>Two things occur, the library into a folder called node_module, and lastly, it automatically modifies the package.json file to keep track of moment.js as a project dependency. Now if we wish to share the project, we can share the package.json file and other developers can install the required packages automatically with the command npm install.</p>
                <img src="./Images/nodueModule.png" alt="">
                <h3>Downside of just npm updates.</h3>
                <p>The bad thing is right now we’re digging through the node_modules folder to find the location of each package and manually including it in our HTML. To overcome this, we can use webpack, a javascript module bundler. Most programming languages provide a way to import code from one file into another. JavaScript wasn’t originally designed with this feature. For the longest time, organizing JavaScript code in multiple files required you to load each file with variables shared globally.
                </p>
                <h3>Common JS</h3>
                <p>A big part of CommonJS was its specification for modules, which would finally allow JavaScript to import and export code across files like most programming languages, without resorting to global variables. The most well-known of implementation of CommonJS modules is node.js. Node.js is a JavaScript runtime designed to run on the server.</p>
                <h3>Why does Node Js make handling updates easier?</h3>
                <p>Instead of loading all of moment.min.js with an HTML script tag, you can load it directly in the JavaScript file as follows: <code>var moment = require('moment');</code>require('./node_modules/moment/min/moment.min.js), you can simply write require('moment') — pretty sweet. Which works great since node.js is a server side language with access to the computer’s file system.</p>
                <h3>What are some issues with using nodeJs on the browser?</h3>
                <p> You’d get an error saying require is not defined. The browser doesn’t have access to the file system, which means loading modules in this way is very tricky — loading files has to be done dynamically, either synchronously (which slows down execution) or asynchronously (which can have timing issues).</p>
                <h3>How do we get around NodeJS issues on the browser?</h3>
                <p>We will use modular bundlers. We need a module bundler to find all require statements (which is invalid browser JavaScript syntax) and replace them with the actual contents of each required file. The most current popular one will be webpack which was made popular because of react, and stems from an earlier one called Browserify.</p>
                <h3>How do we use webpack?</h3>
                <p>Since webpack is a npm package, we will download it with npm, <code>$ npm install webpack webpack-cli --save-dev</code> webpack-cli package allows us to use webpack from the terminal. While the save dev  this saves it as a development dependency, which means it’s a package that you need in your development environment but not on your production server. </p>
                <h3>How to change one code into another code type?</h3>
                <p>Transpiling code means converting the code in one language to code in another similar language. This is an important part of frontend development — since browsers are slow to add new features, new languages were created with experimental features that transpile to browser compatible languages.</p>
                <h3>What is a task runner?</h3>
                <p>A task runner for frontend tasks includes minifying code, optimizing images, running tests, etc.</p>
                <h3>Run down of history</h3>
                <p>So this is modern JavaScript in a nutshell. We went from plain HTML and JS to using a package manager to automatically download 3rd party packages, a module bundler to create a single script file, a transpiler to use future JavaScript features, and a task runner to automate different parts of the build process.</p>
                <h3>What does NPM do?</h3>
                <p>The node package manager is a command-line tool that gives you access to a gigantic repository of plugins, libraries and tools. npm is the world's largest software registry. Open source developers from every continent use npm to share and borrow packages, and many organizations use npm to manage private development as well.</p>
                <h3>JSON files having dependency and dev dependency</h3>
                <p>a dependency will be part of the package if someone else uses it, but a dev dependency won't be. In theory, other people shouldn't need the dev dependency to work.</p>
                <h3>Why should we start using bundlers(ex:webpack)?</h3>
                <p>A project consisting of a single, long file with lots of code can be made easier to navigate and maintain by being broken down into multiple smaller files (modules). The trade off to this more managelably files is cost and time, the browser would need to make a separate HTTP request for each file and if libraries are involed, it can make it even slower. Webpack essentially: it makes multiple files and/or import multiple third-party libraries but eventually combine them all into fewer files at the end so the browser did not have to make so many requests </p>
                <h3>How does Webpack work?</h3>
                <p>Give a bundler a starting file (an entry point) and it will build a dependency graph of the modules and dependencies starting from that file, then combine them into a single output file</p>
                <h3>Why do we include a src and dist in our structure?</h3>
                <p>The "source" (src) code is the code that we'll write and edit. The "distribution" code is the minimized and optimized output of our build process that will eventually be loaded in the browser. </p>
                <h3>NPM how to instal as dev dependency vs depenecy</h3>
                <p>When installing a package that will be bundled into your production bundle, you should use npm install --save. If you're installing a package for development purposes (e.g. a linter, testing libraries, etc.) then you should use npm install --save-dev.</p>
                <h3>What is the generic setup for webpack?</h3>
                <p>
                    <ol class="listMarginLeft__40px">
                        <li>Make your project folder</li>
                        <li>Cd into it</li>
                        <li>create your packageJason with npm init -y</li>
                        <li>install your webpack <code>npm install webpack webpack-cli --save-dev
                        </code></li>
                        <li>We need to have two folders, a src and dist folders: src - one where we write and edit. The distribution - code is the minimized and optimized</li>
                        <li>Instead of including the script of a library, we will instal the library locally. <code>npm install --save lodash
                        </code> with lodash being an example of a libraray.</li>
                        <li>Once we have downloaded locally, we can import it instead of having it included in a script at index.html. <code>import _ from 'lodash';
                        </code></li>
                        <li>In this setup, index.js explicitly requires lodash to be present, and binds it as _ (no global scope pollution)</li>
                        <li>Webpack can use this information to build a dependency graph. It then uses the graph to generate an optimized bundle where scripts will be executed in the correct order.</li>
                        <li>run <strong>npx webpack</strong>, which will take our script at src/index.js as the entry point, and will generate dist/main.js as the output. </li>
                    </ol>
            </p>

            <h3>Webpack.config file</h3>
            <p>A JS that is used to make sure we don't have to write configurations over and over. It uses module.exports to define an entry, our src, and an output, which uses an object. The path is the folder we want to output to, the dist folder, the filename is whatever name we want to call it, common names is main.js and bundle.js</p>
            <h3>How to shortcut the terminal of webpack</h3>
            <p>After we have done the webpack.config, we can go to the package.json and under scripts, include the word <code>"build": "webpack"</code>now we can just run npm run build.</p>
            <h3>What is Module Syntax?</h3>
            <p>Only two components really, import and export.</p>
            <img src="./Images/es6ExportImport.png" alt="">
            <h3>Why shouldn't you use IIFE if we have ES6?</h3>
            <p>With the introduction of ES6 Modules, the module pattern (IIFEs) is not needed anymore, though you might still encounter them in the wild. When using ES6 modules, only what is exported can be accessed in other modules by importing. Additionally, any declarations made in a module are not automatically added to the global scope. By using ES6 modules, you can keep different parts of your code cleanly separated, which makes writing and maintaining your code much easier and less error-prone.</p>
            <h3>What is the flow with webpack?</h3>
            <p>Anytime we want to add JS, we will add it to the src folder, then export as needed and import into the index.js what we want. After which, we can see how the "normal" code under the dist folder of main.js</p>
            <img src="./Images/exportWebpack.png" alt="">
            <img src="./Images/importWebPack.png" alt="">
            <img src="./Images/mainJSWebpackLook.png" alt="">
            <h3>Named Exports</h3>
            <p>Named exports you will most often use when you have multiple values to export in a module</p>
            <img src="./Images/namedExportWebpack.png" alt="">
            <img src="./Images/namedExportImort.png" alt="">
            <h3>The full power of webpack</h3>
            <p>The first half of what webpack can do is bundling your modules. Another amazing feature is webpack's ability to process and manipulate your code as it bundles this. So, for example, if you would like to use Sass or PostCSS to write your CSS, webpack can allow you to do that. Webpack can manage your images and compress and optimize them for use on the web. Webpack can minify and uglify your code.</p>
            <h3>What occurs if you have multiple HTML pages with Webpack?</h3>
            <p>It will build a dependency graph based on all the imports/exports starting there, before bundling everything into a single .js file in dist. If for whatever reason you needed it to output multiple bundles, then each entry point you give Webpack will produce its own output bundle.
            </p>
            <h3>What is the issue with using webpack with css?</h3>
            <p>Since these sorts of files are not JavaScript, Webpack will not know how to process them unless you tell it how to by including the correct loaders and rules.One of the coolest webpack features is that you can also include any other type of file, besides JavaScript, for which there is a loader or built-in Asset Modules support.</p>
            <h3>How to allow CSS to be added through JS webpack?</h3>
            <p>In order to import a CSS file from within a JavaScript module, you need to install and add the style-loader and css-loader to your module configuration. Remember that you must import the css with <code>import './style.css';
            </code> on the src/index.js file.</p>
            <img src="./Images/installingTerminalWebPackCSS.png" alt="">
            <h3>Regular expression and webpack</h3>
            <p>webpack uses a regular expression to determine which files it should look for and serve to a specific loader. In this case, any file that ends with .css will be served to the style-loader and the css-loader.</p>
            <img src="./Images/regularExpressionsWebpack.png" alt="">
            <h3>How to add images and png with webpack</h3>
            <p>To add we can add another test onto the webpack.config.js file, now we add the tests and type onto the module/rules portion with the appropiate regular expression. Now we add the image we want, in this part we added an image directly into he src folder to be used and then exported it for use.</p>
            <img src="./Images/webpackImg.png" alt="">
            <img src="./Images/addingActualImgWeb.png" alt="">
            <h3>Custom Fonts Webpack addition</h3>
            <p>Just as images and CSS, we need to add fonts into our webpack for them to work if they are custom. This only works if we have downloaded the fonts as a file similar to css.</p>
            <img src="./Images/customFontsWebPack.png" alt="">
            <img src="./Images/customFontsCss.png" alt="">
            <h3>Custom HTML plugins</h3>
            <p>There are two ways to add our JS, we can tell it to inject it into the body, where it will place the JS script at the bottom, or we can inject it to the header, where we have a choice do scriptLoading to defer to improve perfomance a bit. Otherwise change inject to body and remove the scriptloading.</p>
            <img src="./Images/JSScriptDefer.png" alt="">
            <h3>What is output management</h3>
            <p>Output manangement so far we've manually included all our assets in our index.html file, but as your application grows and once you start using hashes in filenames and outputting multiple bundles, it will be difficult to keep managing your index.html file manually. However, a few plugins exist that will make this process much easier to manage.</p>
            <h3>Source maps</h3>
            <p>Source maps: a handy way to track down which source file (index.js, a.js, b.js) an error is coming from when you use webpack to bundle them together. This is essential to debugging bundled code in your browser’s DevTools. If the error comes from b.js the error will reference that file instead of the bundle. In order to make it easier to track down errors and warnings, JavaScript offers source maps, which map your compiled code back to your original source code. If an error originates from b.js, the source map will tell you exactly that. To allow this, we just have to add a devtool into the webpack.config.js</p>
            <img src="./Images/sourceMapsWeb.png" alt="">
            <h3>Choosing dev tools </h3>
            <p>It quickly becomes a hassle to manually run npm run build every time you want to compile your code.There are a couple of different options available in webpack that help you automatically compile your code whenever it changes.
                <ol class="listMarginLeft__40px">
                    <li>webpack's watch mode</li>
                    <li>webpack-dev-server</li>
                </ol>
            Most times we will want to use webpack-dev-server.
            </p>
            <h3>Watch mode vs dev server</h3>
            <p>Watch mode will note changes, you should see that webpack automatically recompiles the changed module!The only downside is that you have to refresh your browser in order to see the changes. For Dev server, we need to install the library, and then tell the conif where to look.This tells webpack-dev-server to serve the files from the dist directory on localhost:8080. In this example we also have an optimization.runtimeChunk: 'single' we have more than one entrypoint on a single HTML page. Lastly, not requrired, but under the package, we add webpack open to run the webpack with just npm start instead of npm run build.
            </p>
            <img src="./Images/installWebPackDevServer.png" alt="">
            <img src="./Images/configDevServer.png" alt="">
            <img src="./Images/npmStartDevServer.png" alt="">
            <h3>Webpack dev setting into production</h3>
            <p>Webpack dev is best suited for development, but when it needs to go into deployment (production), the dedicated production mode optimises this for us. Instead of manually switching between modes in the configuration file as needed, we can use webpack merge. </p>
            <h3>Why does differeing dev and produciton matter?</h3>
            <p>In development, we want strong source mapping and a localhost server with live reloading or hot module replacement. In production, our goals shift to a focus on minified bundles, lighter weight source maps, and optimized assets to improve load time. </p>
            <img src="./Images/installWebPackMerge.png" alt="">
            <h3>How do we set up an enivronment good for merges?</h3>
            <p>In webpack.common.js, we now have setup our entry and output configuration and we've included any plugins that are required for both environments. In webpack.dev.js, we've set mode to development. Also, we've added the recommended devtool for that environment (strong source mapping), as well as our devServer configuration. Finally, in webpack.prod.js,mode is set to production which loads TerserPlugin, which was first introduced by the tree shaking guide.</p>

            <img src="./Images/otherMerge.png" alt="">
            <h3>Running the right environement.</h3>
            <p>You’ll notice the above tutorial does not have a webpack.config.js file. If you do use webpack-merge, make sure that any webpack commands you run (including in an npm script) follow the tutorial and use the --config option to specify which webpack configuration file to use. If you do not specify one, webpack will try to look for webpack.config.js and if it does not find one, it will not be able to bundle correctly!</p>
            <img src="./Images/runningTheRightenv.png" alt="">
            <h3>Spread operator with arguments</h3>
            <p>If we have functions, with multiple parameters, we can set a spread to fill in those parameters if it matches the same amount. IE if an array has 3 numbers in it, and the function has 3 parameters, if using a spread, those values will fill in. </p>

               <h3>Branches</h3>
               <p>Branches can be created by going into the main github repository of whatever project you want.Then on main, create a new branch. The purpose of branches is that is allows us to create pull requests which means a member of the team can check that no crazy issues will arise in the master copy.</p>
               <h3>What is a fork and what does it do?</h3>
               <p>Allows us to have our own copy of the project of the project, copies it into a whole new repository.Mainly use when using someone elses project(s).When finished, create a pull request by going to pull request, new request, and the areas of where we want to send the pull request should be already filled if it was forked.</p>
               <h3>Owner approving pull request</h3>
               <p>If any requests are made for the owner of the original, you can accept a pull request by going into pull requests and then hit merge pull request.</p>
               <h3>Using and exit node</h3>
               <p>To run the Node console, open up your terminal and type node. Type .exit to quit the console.</p>
               <h3>How to recopy a line of code</h3>
               <p>Hit option + up on the arrow key, this will reprint the line above it.</p>
               <h3>How to make branches and git into them</h3>
               <p>To make a new branch use <kbd>git branch (branch name). You can get into the branch use git checkout (branch name).</kbd>To create a branch and get into it <kbd>git checkout -b (branch name)</kbd></p>
               <h3>To see all branches</h3>
               <p>To see what branches you have created use <kbd>git branch</kbd> which also tells you what branch you are in currently. Similar to the effect of ls on the terminal.</p>
            <h3>Finished a branch, time to merge and delete.</h3>
                <p>Once a branch is finished and all work is done, it's time to merge the branch onto the main. <kbd>git merge (branchName)</kbd> Next, once they are merged, you will want to delete the branch otherwise the branches will clutter the memory. Delete with <kbd>git branch -d (branch Name)</kbd> </p>
                <h3>Creating a branch  and to see it on the repository</h3>
                <p>To see the branch is working, use <kbd>git push origin (branch Name)</kbd>After which, on github you can select it with the dropdown.</p>
                <h3>Pushing branches to the main</h3>
                <p>When you you push changes you will now use <kbd>git push origin (branch name)</kbd></p>
                <h3>How to add the branch onto the main branch</h3>
                <p>
                <ol class="listMarginLeft__40px">
                    <li>Remember that you must add, and commit on the branch to itself as you would normally do on the main before you proceed since otherwise nothing will be merged onto main.</li>
                    <li>Checkout the branch we want to merge INTO i.e. main with the command git checkout main.
                </li>
                    <li>Now let’s merge our rps-ui branch into main, our current branch, with git merge rps-ui.</li>
                    <li>If everything goes fine, our rps-ui branch is now successfully merged with main! Use git log and you’ll see all the commits you’ve made to your feature branch on top of the commits you made to the main branch. Now for our final step!</li>
                    <li>Let’s push our main branch into our remote repo by running git push origin main . Go to your GitHub repo and you’ll see that our main branch will have all the changes and commits you made to the rps-ui branch. Congratulations! You’ve successfully pushed your first feature into your production branch!</li>
                    <li>Now that we have all our code in the main branch, we don’t really need our rps-ui branch anymore. Let’s do some cleanup, both locally and in the remote repo. Delete the branch from our local repo with git branch -d rps-ui and also delete it from the remote repo on GitHub with git push --delete origin rps-ui. Congrats, we’re all done with our cleanup!</li>

                    <h3>What is Regex?</h3>
                    <p>A form of checking, check a string of character for matches that confirm to a predefined pattern that we want.</p>
                    <h3>How to Test RegEx</h3>
                    <p>Regex can be tested outside of your code at <a target="_blank" href="https://regex101.com/">Regex101</a></p>
                    <h3>How to give multiple choices for one space</h3>
                    <p>To give multiple options, we will use the [] with the letters we want for that spot. In this instance, both cat and bat will show up since we have the optional letter of c or b, as well as the global flag of g. </p>
                    <img src="./Images/multipleChoiceRegEx.png" alt="">
                    <h3>How to select ranges we DON'T want and to remove any non letters</h3>
                    <p>Selecting what we don't want is with the use of the carrot key ^. In this instance, we will get all words that have some letter, however, if there is a !,.? or any character, it will be removed.</p>
                    <img src="./Images/replaceWithRegex.png" alt="">
                    <h3>Selecting a range</h3>
                    <p>As with the remove example, if we want to select all letters, we can type abcde..., we can get them all eventually. However a better use will be to use the dash to show all letters in between.</p>
                    <h3>What are two ways we can have case insensitive letters</h3>
                    <p>We can either use the i flag for insensitive, or we can have two ranges in one bracket.</p>
                    <img src="./Images/caseIns.png" alt="">
                    <h3>How do repeat certain characters</h3>
                    <p>If we want a range of numbers like in a phone number, we can use [0-9] 10 times,  or we can use an exact amount with {}. And we can set a between value options of between 6 and 12 with the use of {} again. However, if we remove the 12, we can set it to min 6 and up to infinity. </p>

                    <h3>Metacharacters</h3>
                    <p> We need the back slash since it escapes the normal behavior, since just d will look for the literal character.

                            <li>Digit Character <code> \d - [0-9]</code></li>

                    <h3>Start and end patterns</h3>
                    <p>^ and $. Note that the carrot is outside the brackets, meaning it will not negate it, instead it's saying that it must start with the defined characters. </p>

                    <p>When we want to use or, remember that the pipe must be in parenthesis, otherwise you can accidentally be calling a singer letter or the rest of the word.In this example without the parenthesis, we are saying replace the letter p or the word tire. </p>

                    <h3>Linking RegEx to forms</h3>
                    <p>Regex uses the test method found in JS to test whether the value fits the value of the regex. The return values are true and false. In this example we use the name attribute on the HTML to work for both the regex and JS, so it's important to name the similar so the words can be utilized in both ways.</p>

            <h3>What is nodeJS</h3>
            <p>Node JS uses common JS and every file in node is a module. Furthermore, node JS cannot use DOM.</p>
            <h3>Exporting modules</h3>
            <p>Modules are always done is separate files, and when exporting we will use module.export. And once we export it, we <b>HAVE</b>to use the require global as well as ./ for the pathing. Some notes, it's <b>EXPORTS are usuall done in bulk and equal profit.When we import we REQUIRE a license</b></p>
            <img src="./Images/importFunctionNodeJS.png" alt="">
            <img src="./Images/exportFunctionNodeJS.png" alt="">
            <img src="./Images/nodeJSEXportsObjectNodeJS.png" alt="">
            <h3>Built in modules</h3>
            <p>Some modules are built into Node, such as the OS. For these, we <b>DON'T</b>use the ./ as the previous ones.Also for these exmaples, we methods are not the important part, since we can look these up, the important part is just how to call these.</p>
            <img src="./Images/builtInModulesNodeJS.png" alt="">
            <h3>Path Module</h3>
            <p>Path module allows us to interact with file paths. Important since others peoples computers will use different paths since people have different computers. <b>asynch needs call backs and made it seem very long. Callback hell.</b> However, this task is better since the task is offloaded and allows users to keep running the code. To fix this callback hell,we can use promosies or asynch await</p>
            <img src="./Images/synchFSNodeJS.png" alt="">
            <img src="./Images/asynchNodeJSFS.png" alt="">
            <h3>HTTP purpose</h3>
            <p>HTTP is what allows us to set up the web server.</p>
            <h3>HTTP set up</h3>
            <p>Basic set up is creating a server, needs a callback that be anything, but convention is to use req and res, (request and response). Res.write is used to write, but at the time being, we learned that res.end which usually ends the program can also be used to write. We always need to include .end, since without it, the server gets a ping, all response and headers have been sent, it can be, server should consider this complete.</p>
            <img src="./Images/httpNodeJS.png" alt="">
            <img src="./Images/serverNodeJS.png" alt="">
            <h3>Naming NodeJS</h3>
            <p>A folder of JS code can be called either a module, depenecy or package. They all mean the same thing.</p>
            <a href="https://www.npmjs.com">Are some examples to find these</a>
            <a href="./Images/npmInstalNodeJs.png"></a>
            <a href="./Images/usedNPMpackageNodeJS.png"></a>
            <a href="./Images/addNPM.png"></a>
            <h3>JSON file</h3>
            <p>In order for NPMS to be usable when we clone the file on GIT, we will need a JSON folder. To get a JSON folder simply type npm init for step for step, or npm init -y. Remember to make it in the root. Once we push onto git and we don't push the modules, we can clone the repository, and in the terminal, if there is a json, we can type "npm instll" and this will let us now to use all the modules that are in the JSON file.</p>
            <h3>Git ignore</h3>
            <p>When we create our files, we want to use gitignore so that we aren't sending over our modules to git since this is not needed. Insode that file we want to /nameOfFileToIgnore so that it is ingored when we git it over. File will be called gitignore. Then Git Init on the terminal. Git add . . Git Commit -m. Then paste the code you got from gitHub. How does this work if we want to open the file again without the modules? Clone the file, and then run NPM install. Since we have the Json file, this will give us the right modules.</p>
            <h3>Dev dependency</h3>
            <p>When we use node, we will instal it as NPM i nodemon -D. This will save it was a dev dependency on the JSON since in production they won't need node, we use it to make quiality of life better only for us. After that we go to the script under the JSON. After the script we can just do NPM start now to run the code instead of the previous node fileName.js method. However, for nodemon, we can use "dev": "nodemon app.js" under the script section, and then run "npm run dev", which causes nodemon to watch ourfiles, similar to liveserver. To stop nodemon, use command C</p>
            <img src="/Images/jsonScriptNodeJS.png" alt="">
            <img src="./Images/nodemonNodeJs.png" alt="">
            <h3>What does it mean when we say JS is synchonrous and single threaded</h3>
            <p>This means it read it line by line, an interesting way to test time is to use console.log.time() and then console.timeEnd() and this will tell you how fast it reached the first time, to the end time.</p>
            <h3>Example of offloading</h3>
            <p>Set timeout is a great example of offloading content, the program makes the timeout wait until the immediate tasks are completed, and this is because timeout and setinterval and others are asynchronous.</p>
            <img src="./Images/offloadingNodeJS.png" alt="">
            <h3>How to make asynch look better </h3>
            <p>One way we can make asycnh look better is with promises and asycnh await. We moved the messy asycnh inside the promise. Note in this example, we used the path as a variable. But this isn't that imporatant, asycnh await is much more better and explained later. </p>
            <img src="./Images/messyasynch.png" alt="">
            <img src="./Images/promiseAsycnheNodeJS.png" alt="">
            <h3>Promisfy with Asycnh Wait</h3>
            <p>Promisfy is inside the node module and must be required. We can either add the dot promises at the end of the files, or we can create new variables and use util.promisfy. Remember for write file if not data is there, it will create the file and add it. Try catch needed to log if an error occurs. Asynch is a special keyword that lets the use of await.</p>
            <img src="./Images/nodePromisfyLongNodeJS.png" alt="">
            <img src="./Images/nodePromisfyshorterNodeJS.png" alt="">
            <img src="./Images/practicalUseOfAPIandAsyncWait.png" alt="">
            <h3>Event Emitters</h3>
            <p>A lot of built in modules use event emitters. Used heavily in node JS. Users hovering over links or buttons. The flow of the program depends on the events that happen.</p>
            <img src="./Images/eventEmitterNodeJS.png" alt="">
            <h3>Streams</h3>
            <p>Large sources or continuing data. four main types, read, write, duplex (read and write) and transform where data can be modified while reading or writing.</p>
            <h3>Read File</h3>
            <p>One power https://github.com/john-smilga/node-express-course.gitof read file is that we can store the data and paste it onto the local server. readFileSynch vs readFile is that readFile needs a callback.</p>
            <img src="/Images/pastingInfoOnFIleToServer.png" alt="">
            <h3>Stream Chunks</h3>
            <p>Instead of sending large txt files that send data at once, we can send it as chunks. This can be done with streams. Pipe method is what let's us change the readable stream into a writeable stream.</p>

            <h3>What is express?</h3>
            <p>Express is built upon http module, and makes creating servers much more easier.</p>
            <h3>Meta data about the server response</h3>
            <p>A new method will be res.writeHead, which uses a status code (200 being successful) within the create server. Next is contact type,tells the browser, we are sending back html, css, imge, how to render that contact.This is done using key value pairs.</p>
            <img src="./Images/mimeTypesNodeJs.png" alt="">
            <h3>Simple server check</h3>
            <p>As before, we can check the url and test to see if the data is there, if not, we can now give  404 error code with text error. We can also use styles and JS but we would need to check for  the url of each one if we are just using http for checks, express will fix this issue.</p>

            <h3>Installing Express</h3>
            <p>To install express we have to run npm instal express, and to instal a previous updated one, we can run npm install expess@4.17.1. Note that express is a function, so we declare it as a function but also assign it.</p>
            <img src="./Images/basicExpress.png" alt="">
            <h3>How express starts to make things easier with using css/js/svg</h3>
            <p> How to get all the css/js/svg to work, common practice is making a folder named public all files will be moved there. We don't need to make any status or content types, express takes care of it all. Use and express explained later. Statics are files the server doesn't need to change, like images or servers. However, what's better is that we don't even really need to add the sendFile module with the weird __dirname things, we can just drop the index.html into the public folder and it will work the same.</p>
            <img src="./Images/gettingFilesWithExpress.png" alt="">
            <img src="./Images/notNeedForSendFileExpress.png" alt="">
            <h3>API vs SSR</h3>
            <p>API in express setting up http interfance to interact with interface. SSR we will send templates and we will send entire html, js, and css. However, if you understand API, ssr should be easy to grasp. API server provides the data. Somestimes we don't want to use all the data in the api, so we can use map to create a new array with only the info we want. The first image is an example of a very simple API. The second image we exported the data with {} in the data file. Then destructure. Third image is only when we want a miniaml response instead of sending all data, like review or descriptions. Note in the images we do .json and .send, they functionally do about the same.</p>

            <img src="./Images/usePartofAnAPIExpress.png" alt="">
            <h3>Hard Parameters</h3>
            <p>If we wanted to find one product, we can hard code each item like in the first image. But this is a nuclear approach since this can work with 1-4 products, but if we have over 100, this can get messy. This is more theory, the next section on route parameters is much better.</p>
            <img src="./Images/oneProductNuclear.png" alt="">
            <h3>Route Parameters</h3>
            <p>Where we set up the route, we do /:whateverNameWeWant.In this instance we had to use Number since the data had the ID as a number, otherwise we could have just passed in the string. Used when there a lot of other options, and in situations where items have unique characteristics. Using req.params and console.log it we can get a lot of useful properties and methods. Number(ProductId) replace the number 1 of the hard code method, but in this case will find each number and not just 1. Req.params is always use for the route paramters.</p>
            <img src="./Images/routeParameterExpress.png" alt="">
            <img src="./Images/ifRouteDoesNotExist.png" alt="">
            <h3>Query String Parameter/URL parameters</h3>
            <p>Small amount of info to the server using the URL. Look at the URL, anything after the ? specific info on the data requested.Here we use limit, but search works too, and search=a&limit=2. Filter query data, etc, that's on us to decide. In this example, the URL uses search which just brings up anything that starts with a.This example is specific for if we decide to use search or limit query. The other image is for when the code works, but no product was found to match the search.</p>
            <img src="./Images/querySelectorWithLimitExpress.png" alt="">
            <img src="./Images/workingURLParaNOProductFound.png" alt="">
            <h3>Cannot set headers after they are sent</h3>
            <p>If we get this error, look at your returns, what happens is if we use res.status more than once in a block of code, it causes express to freak out, correct it by using returns.</p>
            <h3>MiddleWare in Express</h3>
            <p>Functions that execute during the request to the server. Before we simply did a reqeust and then a response. Now we will have a middle poriton between the two. One issue we can come accross is that for the first image, this can work, but for this to work for the about URL, we would need to copy and paste the same four lines of code, this is not needed. When we work with middleware, we must pass it on onto another middleware or terminating it. The next image is a simple middle ware example, req, res, and next are handled with express, and we must always use a next to pass it on, or a res.send. The middleware is placed in between each path, note we missed the logger in the about URL. What better though would be to create a new file called logger and then export it like normal. An even better approach is to create a new file, nd then use app.use which acts as a special method just for middleware. We just need to define all URL parameters we want to match. We can create routes, if we used app.use("/api",logger) this works for all routes, generic route.</p>

            <img src="./Images/simpleMiddleWare.png" alt="">
            <img src="./Images/appUse.png" alt="">
            <h3>More complex middleware</h3>
            <p>To use more than one middleware, we must use bracket notation inside the app.use method. The second image shows it's importance, here, now any URL parameter we have that has ?user=john, we get specifc things related to John only. Any of the routes we can access to that user. </p>
            <img src="./Images/doubleMiddleWare.png" alt="">
            <img src="./Images/whyIsItImportant.png" alt="">
            <h3>Middleware options</h3>
            <p>Are main options for middleware is our own, express, and third party middleware. One of the most popular one is morgan NPM. Remember that third party ones would need an install.</p>
            <h3>Maniuplating data</h3>
            <p>The first image is the use of express built in middleware on a folder that we have created before. For Post, we can't just do a post action, we need to use a tool called postman or insomia, or we can set up a working app. For this example, this will be seen in working HTML. Method is post, action is where it's going to be sent. Marks the URL on the server. In the second image, the issue we have is that there is not route. First fix is to make one, with the use of post method, not get. Next issue, we have no way to get this data, to get the data, we have to use a middleware, seen with urlextended with extended false flag. And lastly with this way, we can also check to see if a name was given, note though, this could have been done with front end.</p>

            <img src="./Images/optionToCheckNameGivenMiddlware.png" alt="">
            <h3>Post with Javascript</h3>
            <p>This first example has the post method done with javascript and uses the help of axios.Though major problem in set up, if we need to create  frontend for every route, the production is going to take very long. Better option will be to use Postman, which tests for APIs.</p>
            <img src="./Images/JSPostExpress.png" alt="">
            <img src="./Images/middleWareJSPostExample.png" alt="">
            <h3>Postman Use</h3>
            <p>Postman is a neat tool that tests for URLs. To create  check, we click on the + found where the mouse is over, and then enter the localhost url and path we want to check. Intead of building a full front end to test, we can just use postman. For post, we can text by going under the body, then raw, then JSON text.</p>
            <img src="./Images/postmanBasicCheck.png" alt="">
            <img src="./Images/postManPostTest.png" alt="">
            <h3>Put/delete Method</h3>
            <p>Made for modyfying the data. When we send a put, if the body exists, something to update. Two things we want, the value of the params, IE the value we added on. Update we need to send something to the body. Note the console log of 1 peter. Where 1 is the ID and the value is peter. Both delete and put are very similar and typically copy and paste most of it. Big difference is that at the end we will use a filter not a map. </p>
            <img src="./Images/putAndPostMan.png" alt="">
            <h3>Express</h3>
            <p>Express lets us group many routes ti help break up the code from being too long with all these routes. Common convention is to create a new folder under the correct CD main, and naming it routes. The first require is for the route of the files you created. The app.use is the middleware, which creates the path. </p>

            <h3>Task Manager API</h3>
            <p>Goals here are to set up and connect to cloud database. A use CRUD on our data, cread read update and delete. We use patch instead of out this time for updates. The Router.route think of that as we are going to use the "variable" defined in the main JS with app.use("/api/v1/...") </p>
            <img src="./Images/taskManagerStart.png" alt="">
            <p>We then follow up with </p>
            <img src="./Images/chainingRequests.png" alt="">
            <h3>Create files for controllers and routes</h3>
            <p>Typically, large files can be organized with the use of controllers and routes folders. Routes are folders that pretty much will always have the controllers and get.post.delete routes. Controllers with typically have the function names, controllers holds all the logic, we can in theory have the logic all in the routes, but it will get messy. We are simply writing the req and res of the route section again, remember to export it and require it in the route folder.</p>
            <img src="./Images/ControllersPurpose.png" alt="">
            <h3>Reminder on what request does what</h3>
            <p>Get can get all tasks or one. Post can create a new one, delete deletes, patch updtaes tasks. For upate, delete, and single task get we will use a route paramter</p>
            <h3>What is REST API?</h3>
            <p>HTTP interface so other apps can interact with our data. Representation state transfer, most popular API desing pattern. Determines what the API looks like, a pattern, no strictly enforced.</p>
            <img src="./Images/CommonRestAPI.png" alt="">
            <h3>MongoDB</h3>

            <h3>Connect database from the server</h3>
            <p>Object Data modeling library, a way to ger this done with Mongoose. It comes with a lot of things that make Development faster. Install with npm install mongoose. Second step is to set up a connection. Add it onto the man made DS folder, above the connection string we pasted earlier. We named it 3-task manager in this instance. One issue I notice was that the cluster password is different from your user password you made to create the account, this password is important since without it you won't be able to connect to your database when you pass the string along. After you copy and pasted the link, we need to require mongoose on the DB, using the right password and projectName. Afterwards, we can use the method of connect to crete the two, with the variable of the link string, and a then catch since this is a promise. Lastly, on the main app, we can require it without a variable and it will be automatically called. <code>require('./DB/ConnectJS');
            </code></p>

            <img src="./Images/ConnectingWorks.png" alt="">
            <h3>Running DB before server</h3>
            <p>One issue is that we should really check if the server is up first, if it is then run the server. The first image has the code rewritten as a function, which now be exported and imported. Once imported, we create a new function called start, and we set it up as asynch wait since it is a promise. Lastly, we move the server after the try of the DB variable, and if that's ok, then it will run the server listen. Lastly the function is called.</p>

            <img src="./Images/connectFirstPart3.png" alt="">
            <h3>Holding our secrets before push</h3>
            <p>All projects hve the potential to have our secrets, to prevent this we need to create a .env file and use a package called dotenv, also make sure gitingnore is ignoring .env. Here we take that secret snippet and have it as just code, not quatation marks in the ENV under some variable name. After which, under the DB we want to remove the secret code as well as the connect variable and use URL.</p>

            <img src="./Images/removeOldScript.png" alt="">
            <img src="./Images/replaceWithURL.png" alt="">
            <h3>Require ENV</h3>
            <p>To require ENV we need to simply call the require, no need with variable with a .config method. Next in the are where we simply called the DB in the require, we add the paramater of the ENV by first doing process.env.(Varibale Name) that we defined in the ENV file</p>
            <h3>What does Schema do?</h3>
            <p>Schema does the structure of our data. It does not make sense to be able to add an array of colors in a book data, this prevents that. We will create a new folder and file called models. Then we will create this simple set up.</p>
            <img src="./Images/basicSchema.png" alt="">
            <h3>What a model?</h3>
            <p>Representation for the collection. A model is a wrapper for the schema. The model gives the interface to the data. The model looks for two things, the name and then the schema.After this, we can use it in our controllers.</p>
