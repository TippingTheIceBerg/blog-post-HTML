        <p>During my study I found myself creating lots of empty docs that I would title "practice" or "test" and came to realize that I forget what these sections are and what I was testing. I figured making sections for these test sections will be better by creating a site that holds all my tests and that will  help me remember tips to problems.</p>

        <section id="HTML" class="section__HTML section">
            <h2>HTML</h2>
            <div>
                <h3>Removing lists bullet points</h3>
                <p>To remove the bullet points in lists, you will use list-style: none</p>
                <h3>Quickly open the terminal</h3>
                <p>To quickly open a terminal simply press fn + f12</p>
                <h3>Opening inspect tool</h3>
                <p>To avoid right clicking and hitting inspect every time, it's faster to just hit command + option + c
                </p>
                <h3>How to apply classes in devtools</h3>
                <p>First open dev tools, next click on what section you want to test a class on with the selector arrow. Next you want to click on .cls which is found right under the index.html but above where the styles are seen. After you click on it you just need to type the class name</p>
                <h3>How to quickly select with the pointer in dev tools</h3>
                <p><kbd>command + shift + c</kbd></p>
                <h3>How to test all hover effects</h3>
                <p>open dev tools, then click on :hov. This section in of itself does not apply the hover selection, it would need to be selected after. </p>
                <h3>Debugging and changing CSS animations</h3>
                <p>Open dev tools on Google Chrome, then select the three vertical dots, more tools, and then click on animations. To see the animations captured the page will need to be refreshed or the animation played.</p>
                <h3>Readability with contrast ratio check</h3>
                <p>First select the element you want to select. Then select the color used for that element. Then select contrast ratio. Anything within the lines is the min requirement for readability. Anything below is better.</p>
                <p>An alternative method is by going into more tools and selecting CSS overview in the event the contrast ratio does not show up.</p>
                <h3>How to find quick selections</h3>
                <p>To find areas of the dev tools, <kbd>command + shift + p</kbd> one example will be to perform a screenshot of the page, open the shortcut above, and then type screenshot.</p>
                <h3>What is the difference in kbd vs code?</h3>
                <p>KBD is for user input while code is for a fragment in computer code</p>
                <h3>Ways to debug JS</h3>
                <p>Four of the most common ways to debug JS
                    <ol class="listMarginLeft__40px">
                        <li><code>console.log(var)</code></li>
                        <li><code>console.log({var})</code></li>
                        <li><code>console.table(var)</code></li>
                        <li><code>console.trace(var)</code></li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
                <h3>Rearrange the DOM in the dev tools</h3>
                <p>To reorder the DOM, simply drag and drop in the dev tools.</p>
                <h3>Force states</h3>
                <p>Select an element in the dev tools and right click it, change pseudo class, and then select whatever you want.</p>
                <h3>Hide a Node</h3>
                <p>Select the element in the dev tools, then hit <kbd>H</kbd></p>
                <h3>Copy a selected Element as a JS path</h3>
                <p>Select the element (in google chrome only),right click on the dev tools, and then copy as a JS path.</p>
                <h3>BEM naming conventions</h3>
                <p>This area will be solely dedicated to naming conventions of popular styling </p>

                <h3>How to take screenshots of code in VS</h3>
                <p>Highlight the portion of the code you want to screenshot. Next, right click on SnapCode. Last, when the new window opens up, click on the logo and then save it where you want to find it.</p>
            </div>
        </section>
        <section id="CSS" class="section__CSS section">
            <h2>CSS</h2>
            <div>
                <h3>Relative and Absolute</h3>
                <p>Position relative is based off its relative position but can be adjusted with left,top,right,and bottom. The power of Relative is that it make position absolute relative to position relative.</p>
                <h3>FontAwesome</h3>
                <p>The best way to add FontAwesome will be to add it via download. The file at the moment would need to be downloaded each time and then moved either into it's own folder on the site you're working on in VS code.Next, you will need to move down the file until you hit css/all.min. Another think you can do is delete the other files in FontAwesome to save some space, ie anything in JS and less. </p>
                <h3>Choice of Border Color</h3>
                <p>Choosing a border the color of the main text seems best, choose your color and lower the opacity until you get the desire color.</p>
                <h3>Background-size vs Background-position</h3>
                <p>Background-size has to do with how large the img should behave, this is where we see contain and cover. Contain being it showing the whole img, and if it doesn't cover the whole area the empty space will take up the background-color prop, but the img will never be cropped.cover is when the img filled the container fully, and does crop the img if the container isn't large enough.Background-position has to do with where you want the img to be viewed, this is the one where you use center,left,right,etc</p>
                <h3>Color Scheme: How to choose your colors</h3>
                <p>First go into the following site <a href="https://www.designspiration.com/search/saves/?q=colour" target="#">Color Picker</a>, and to help narrow the search on colors think of a couple things 
                <ol class="listMarginLeft__40px">
                <li>Target Audience, a funeral home vs fast food will use different colors.</li>
                <li>Does the Logo offer any colors?</li>
                <li>Play the word game, write down things that remind you of your site, and you should think of what color define these.</li>
                </ol>
                some quick tips, a lighter shade works more for fresh energy brands, while darker ones are more for corporate serious brands. Next you want to keep in mind that most sites will use three base colors, white, gray, and a light gray. With this in mind, you will choose only a base color, the color you choose when you were thinking of a color at the list above,and an accent color. Once you have your color, go to <a href="https://paletton.com/#uid=1000u0kllllaFw0g0qFqFg0w0aF" target="#">accent color finder</a>.Enter your color into the wheel, and then click on add complimentary color near right of the selections. The color red below is #FFA5A5 and acts as the accent while the green below is #9AEE9C,and acts as the base color. After the accent, you will use two different grays, a darker and lighter one.The dark one is used for text. The gray needed can be find by entering your based color into the search bar of <a href="https://dribbble.com/" target="#">Dribble</a>  followed by the word website,and find a gray that matches your color choice.
                <div class="colorChooser__baseAndAccentColor"></div>
                The main color will be used for large areas and icons. The accent color for buttons and smaller areas, call to action areas.Dark gray for text and icon outlines, and the white and light gray are used for the background.
                Another tip will be to set everything to gray scale and then add color later.

                <h3>Adjusted img width</h3>
                <p>To avoid changing the proportion of an image, we can focus instead on just changing the width of the image. This is done by setting the height:auto, width to whatever size you want it to be. It's best to add a width and height to images even if you don't plan on changing them. The reasoning is that by adding a width and height, the page will load the white space it plans to take up, and won't cause sudden slow down once the rest of the content loads in. </p>
                <h3>Low Cost Animations</h3>
                <p>Most animations should fall within these four, if not,they will use up much more memory
                    <ol class="listMarginLeft__40px">
                        <li>Position - <code>transform: translate(npx,npx)</code></li>
                        <li>Scale - <code>transform: scale(n)</code></li>
                        <li>Rotation - <code>transform: rotate(ndeg)</code></li>
                        <li>Opacity - <code>opacity: 0...1</code></li>
                    </ol>

                <h3>box-sizing: border-box</h3>
                <p>The purpose of border-box involves the box model, where the padding and border are included in the height of the element. With border-box, if you enter <code>width: 100px; height:100px;</code>the element will be exactly 100px by 100px. To showcase this, if you have <code>padding:10px; border:10px solid; height:100px; width:100px</code> .Without border box the total width and height will be 140px x 140px since we gave the content 100px x 100px but then the padding and border are added after, changing the height and width.  With border box, the height x width of the content will be 60px x 60px; with the padding and border taking up their 20px x 20px each.The height and width of the element of the whole will now be 100px x 100px as intended</p>
                <p>To further explore this, this is taken from <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/The_box_model">Web Docs</a>. <em>"In the standard box model, if you give a box a width and a height attribute, this defines the width and height of the content box. Any padding and border is then added to that width and height to get the total size taken up by the box. The actual space taken up by the box will be 410px wide (350 + 25 + 25 + 5 + 5) and 210px high (150 + 25 + 25 + 5 + 5)."</em></p>
                <p> 
                    <code>.box {
                    width: 350px;
                    height: 150px;
                    margin: 10px;
                    padding: 25px;
                    border: 5px solid black;}
                    </code>
                </p>

                <h3>Outer display</h3>
                    <h4>Display Block</h4>
                    <p>An outer display. A block will take up its own line, it will take up the full width of the container, and border,margin, and padding will push things away from it.</p>
                    <h4>Display inline</h4>
                    <p>An outer display.A new line won't be made, height and width won't apply, only horizontal padding,margins, and border will push things away.</p>
                <h3>Inner Display</h3>
                    <h4>Display: Flex</h4>
                    <p>With Display: Flex the outer display will be block,but the inner display will now be flexed.</p>
                <h3>Margin Collapsing</h3>
                <p>If two elements margin touch, they won't combine, they would just be the marin of the larger of the two. If one is negative, then they would subtract from the larger of the two. <em> "The top paragraph has a margin-bottom of 50 pixels. The second paragraph has a margin-top of 30 pixels. The margins have collapsed together so the actual margin between the boxes is 50 pixels and not the total of the two margins." - <a href="http://127.0.0.1:5501/index.html#">Web Doc</a></em> </p>
                <h3>Border Styling</h3>
                <p>While border shorthand is the fastest way to do it, the alternative will be to use border-style,border-color, and color-width. For more advanced styling each width,style, and color can be used with border-(top,right,bottom,left)-(width,style,color)</p>
                <h3>Padding values</h3>
                <p>Padding does not take negative values.</p>
