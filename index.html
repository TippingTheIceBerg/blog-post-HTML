        <p>During my study I found myself creating lots of empty docs that I would title "practice" or "test" and came to realize that I forget what these sections are and what I was testing. I figured making sections for these test sections will be better by creating a site that holds all my tests and that will  help me remember tips to problems.</p>

            <h2>HTML</h2>
            <div>
                <h3>Removing lists bullet points</h3>
                <p>To remove the bullet points in lists, you will use list-style: none</p>
                <h3>Quickly open the terminal</h3>
                <p>To quickly open a terminal simply press fn + f12</p>
                <h3>Opening inspect tool</h3>
                <p>To avoid right clicking and hitting inspect every time, it's faster to just hit command + option + c
                </p>
                <h3>How to apply classes in devtools</h3>
                <p>First open dev tools, next click on what section you want to test a class on with the selector arrow. Next you want to click on .cls which is found right under the index.html but above where the styles are seen. After you click on it you just need to type the class name</p>
                <h3>How to quickly select with the pointer in dev tools</h3>
                <p><kbd>command + shift + c</kbd></p>
                <h3>How to test all hover effects</h3>
                <p>open dev tools, then click on :hov. This section in of itself does not apply the hover selection, it would need to be selected after. </p>
                <h3>Debugging and changing CSS animations</h3>
                <p>Open dev tools on Google Chrome, then select the three vertical dots, more tools, and then click on animations. To see the animations captured the page will need to be refreshed or the animation played.</p>
                <h3>Readability with contrast ratio check</h3>
                <p>First select the element you want to select. Then select the color used for that element. Then select contrast ratio. Anything within the lines is the min requirement for readability. Anything below is better.</p>
                <p>An alternative method is by going into more tools and selecting CSS overview in the event the contrast ratio does not show up.</p>
                <h3>How to find quick selections</h3>
                <p>To find areas of the dev tools, <kbd>command + shift + p</kbd> one example will be to perform a screenshot of the page, open the shortcut above, and then type screenshot.</p>
                <h3>What is the difference in kbd vs code?</h3>
                <p>KBD is for user input while code is for a fragment in computer code</p>
                <h3>Ways to debug JS</h3>
                <p>Four of the most common ways to debug JS
                    <ol class="listMarginLeft__40px">
                        <li><code>console.log(var)</code></li>
                        <li><code>console.log({var})</code></li>
                        <li><code>console.table(var)</code></li>
                        <li><code>console.trace(var)</code></li>
                    </ol>
                    When debugging it's best to replicate what causes the bug first. Open the console with <kbd>command + option + j</kbd> (only on chrome) then move to sources. Now open the Event Listener Breakpoints, for clicks we will got o mouse, then on clicks. Now when you click on a button, it will highlight that line of code. If incorrect line, hit the resume button, located right above the the yellow bar that says our code has been paused. When we feel we know where the bug occurs, we can set a breakpoint by clicking to the left of the JS file number and set a blue arrow, this will now pause here when we resume the call with the pause start button mentioned before. Make  a change in the JS code with saving with <kbd>command + s</kbd> to save, and then test the button again.

                <h3>debug Functions</h3>
                <p>Easy way to debug function is to call debug(functionName), however make sure it is in scope.</p>
                <h3>Rearrange the DOM in the dev tools</h3>
                <p>To reorder the DOM, simply drag and drop in the dev tools.</p>
                <h3>Force states</h3>
                <p>Select an element in the dev tools and right click it, change pseudo class, and then select whatever you want.</p>
                <h3>Hide a Node</h3>
                <p>Select the element in the dev tools, then hit <kbd>H</kbd></p>
                <h3>Copy a selected Element as a JS path</h3>
                <p>Select the element (in google chrome only),right click on the dev tools, and then copy as a JS path.</p>
                <h3>BEM naming conventions</h3>
                <p>This area will be solely dedicated to naming conventions of popular styling </p>

                <h3>How to take screenshots of code in VS</h3>
                <p>Highlight the portion of the code you want to screenshot. Next, right click on SnapCode. Last, when the new window opens up, click on the logo and then save it where you want to find it.</p>
                <h3>Lazy Loading with HTML</h3>
                <p>On images we can use a shorthand for lazy loading with the attribute loading. Some drawbacks are that not all browsers support it, but it can helpful on speeding up a page.</p>
                <img loading="lazy" src="./Images/lazyLoading.png" alt="">
                <h3>How to open links in a separate tab.</h3>
                <p>When using a link tag, use <code>target="_blank"</code>, this causes a new tab to be open while not overwriting other opened links.</p>
                <h3>Use of Labels and select</h3>
                <p>whenever we want a dropdown function, we will use select and the children will be options.
                    <label for="weather">Select the weather type today: </label>
                    <select id="weather">
                    <option value="">--Make a choice--</option>
                    <option value="sunny">Sunny</option>
                    <option value="rainy">Rainy</option>
                    <option value="snowing">Snowing</option>
                    <option value="overcast">Overcast</option>
                    </select>
                </p>
                <img src="./Images/labelAndSelect.png" alt="">
                <h3>To show potential repairs</h3>
                <p>To show potential repairs open the command line with <kbd>command + shift + p</kbd> and then type Rendering, this will open a new menu with lots of helps, look under paint flashing. </p>
                <h3>To add or remove classes</h3>
                <p>click on the .cls tab and enter new classes, or remove the check marks to disable others.</p>
                <h3>Easy Edits: shadow and transform</h3>
                <p>For easy movement, go to google chrome see the Angle clock for any transform properties, and use the square layers to check for shadows with blurriness and X and Y offset.</p>
                <h3>Easy Breakpoints for media queries</h3>
                <p>To change Media Queries break points, first make it into mobile mode, then select the ... options., then select show media queries. Once selected, click on the top of the bars, the blue and orange bars to select the break points.</p>
            </div>
        </section>
        <section id="CSS" class="section__CSS section">
            <h2>CSS</h2>
            <div>
                <h3>Relative and Absolute</h3>
                <p>Position relative is based off its relative position but can be adjusted with left,top,right,and bottom. The power of Relative is that it make position absolute relative to position relative.</p>
                <h3>FontAwesome</h3>
                <p>The best way to add FontAwesome will be to add it via download. The file at the moment would need to be downloaded each time and then moved either into it's own folder on the site you're working on in VS code.Next, you will need to move down the file until you hit css/all.min. Another think you can do is delete the other files in FontAwesome to save some space, ie anything in JS and less. </p>
                <h3>Other choices of font</h3>
                <p><a target="_blank"href="https://www.fontspace.com/collection">Font spacen</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.dafont.com/">Dafont</a></p>
                <h3>Choice of Border Color</h3>
                <p>Choosing a border the color of the main text seems best, choose your color and lower the opacity until you get the desire color.</p>
                <h3>Background-size vs Background-position</h3>
                <p>Background-size has to do with how large the img should behave, this is where we see contain and cover. Contain being it showing the whole img, and if it doesn't cover the whole area the empty space will take up the background-color prop, but the img will never be cropped.cover is when the img filled the container fully, and does crop the img if the container isn't large enough.Background-position has to do with where you want the img to be viewed, this is the one where you use center,left,right,etc</p>
                <h3>Color Scheme: How to choose your colors</h3>
                <p>First go into the following site <a href="https://www.designspiration.com/search/saves/?q=colour" target="_blank">Color Picker</a>, and to help narrow the search on colors think of a couple things 
                <ol class="listMarginLeft__40px">
                <li>Target Audience, a funeral home vs fast food will use different colors.</li>
                <li>Does the Logo offer any colors?</li>
                <li>Play the word game, write down things that remind you of your site, and you should think of what color define these.</li>
                </ol>
                some quick tips, a lighter shade works more for fresh energy brands, while darker ones are more for corporate serious brands. Next you want to keep in mind that most sites will use three base colors, white, gray, and a light gray. With this in mind, you will choose only a base color, the color you choose when you were thinking of a color at the list above,and an accent color. Once you have your color, go to <a href="https://paletton.com/#uid=1000u0kllllaFw0g0qFqFg0w0aF" target="_blank">accent color finder</a>.Enter your color into the wheel, and then click on add complimentary color near right of the selections. The color red below is #FFA5A5 and acts as the accent while the green below is #9AEE9C,and acts as the base color. After the accent, you will use two different grays, a darker and lighter one.The dark one is used for text. The gray needed can be find by entering your based color into the search bar of <a href="https://dribbble.com/" target="_blank">Dribble</a>  followed by the word website,and find a gray that matches your color choice.
                <div class="colorChooser__baseAndAccentColor"></div>
                The main color will be used for large areas and icons. The accent color for buttons and smaller areas, call to action areas.Dark gray for text and icon outlines, and the white and light gray are used for the background.
                Another tip will be to set everything to gray scale and then add color later.
                </p>
                <h3>Adjusted img width</h3>
                <p>To avoid changing the proportion of an image, we can focus instead on just changing the width of the image. This is done by setting the height:auto, width to whatever size you want it to be. It's best to add a width and height to images even if you don't plan on changing them. The reasoning is that by adding a width and height, the page will load the white space it plans to take up, and won't cause sudden slow down once the rest of the content loads in. Another note, if a width hasn't been decided, setting a <code>max-width:100%</code> is a good fall back since it'll fit the size of the viewport. </p>
                <h3>Low Cost Animations</h3>
                <p>Most animations should fall within these four, if not,they will use up much more memory
                    <ol class="listMarginLeft__40px">
                        <li>Position - <code>transform: translate(npx,npx)</code></li>
                        <li>Scale - <code>transform: scale(n)</code></li>
                        <li>Rotation - <code>transform: rotate(ndeg)</code></li>
                        <li>Opacity - <code>opacity: 0...1</code></li>
                    </ol>

                </p>
                <h3>box-sizing: border-box</h3>
                <p>The purpose of border-box involves the box model, where the padding and border are included in the height of the element. With border-box, if you enter <code>width: 100px; height:100px;</code>the element will be exactly 100px by 100px. To showcase this, if you have <code>padding:10px; border:10px solid; height:100px; width:100px</code> .Without border box the total width and height will be 140px x 140px since we gave the content 100px x 100px but then the padding and border are added after, changing the height and width.  With border box, the height x width of the content will be 60px x 60px; with the padding and border taking up their 20px x 20px each.The height and width of the element of the whole will now be 100px x 100px as intended</p>
                <p>To further explore this, this is taken from <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/The_box_model">Web Docs</a>. <em>"In the standard box model, if you give a box a width and a height attribute, this defines the width and height of the content box. Any padding and border is then added to that width and height to get the total size taken up by the box. The actual space taken up by the box will be 410px wide (350 + 25 + 25 + 5 + 5) and 210px high (150 + 25 + 25 + 5 + 5)."</em></p>
                <p> 
                    <code>.box {
                    width: 350px;
                    height: 150px;
                    margin: 10px;
                    padding: 25px;
                    border: 5px solid black;}
                    </code>

                <h3>Outer display</h3>
                    <h4>Display Block</h4>
                    <p>An outer display. A block will take up its own line, it will take up the full width of the container, and border,margin, and padding will push things away from it.</p>
                    <h4>Display inline</h4>
                    <p>An outer display.A new line won't be made, height and width won't apply, only horizontal padding,margins, and border will push things away.</p>
                <h3>Inner Display</h3>
                    <h4>Display: Flex</h4>
                    <p>With Display: Flex the outer display will be block,but the inner display will now be flexed.</p>
                <p><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_blocks.asp">For a full list of inline and block elements</a></p>
                <h3>Margin Collapsing</h3>
                <p>If two elements margin touch, they won't combine, they would just be the marin of the larger of the two. If one is negative, then they would subtract from the larger of the two. <em> "The top paragraph has a margin-bottom of 50 pixels. The second paragraph has a margin-top of 30 pixels. The margins have collapsed together so the actual margin between the boxes is 50 pixels and not the total of the two margins." - <a href="http://127.0.0.1:5501/index.html#">Web Doc</a></em> <strong>This only applies for vertical margins.</strong> </p>
                <h3>Border Styling</h3>
                <p>While border shorthand is the fastest way to do it, the alternative will be to use border-style,border-color, and color-width. For more advanced styling each width,style, and color can be used with border-(top,right,bottom,left)-(width,style,color)</p>
                <h3>Padding values</h3>
                <p>Padding does not take negative values.</p>
                <h3>Inline-block</h3>
                <p>Since padding does not effect inline elements like <code>a</code> and <code>span</code>, using inline-block allows us to make sure these don't form on a new line, but allows us to apply padding,height,width, and does now all overlapping</p>
                <h3>Margin Auto Horizontal Centering</h3>
                <p>Auto will usually be 0, or whatever space is available on the side. For this to work, you need a defined width.Then set margin as <code>margin: 0 auto</code>.<strong>This only works for horizontal centering</strong></p>
                <h3>Justify-content</h3>
                <p>Justify-content works with placing flex items without having to change the width on the main axis.</p><ul class="listMarginLeft__40px">
                    <li>Space-between</li>
                    <p>Space between makes sure that each space between them are laid out evenly, any after that is not between another item is not accounted for, which is why you have the first item and last item pushed all the way to the ends.</p>
                    <li>Space-around</li>
                    <p>Space around causes the spacing between items to be the same, but gives the last and first item equal space to the left and right of the ends.</p>
                    <li>Space-evenly</li>
                    <p>Space-evenly causes all spaces to be even, including the end points.</p>
                </ul>
                <img src="./Images/justifyContent.svg" alt="">
                <h3>align-items</h3>
                <p>align-items works by placing items on the cross axis, which is typically vertical.</p>
                <h3>Main axis vs cross axis</h3>
                <p>Taken from the  <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-alignment" target="_blank">Odin Project</a>.<em> "Because justify-content and align-items are based on the main and cross axis of your container, their behavior changes when you change the flex-direction of a flex-container. For example, when you change flex-direction to column, justify-content aligns vertically and align-items aligns horizontally."</em></p>

                <h3>Flex-shrink</h3>
                <p>When a flex items is not taken up as much space as you would like, try giving it a flex-shrink of 0, this causes the item to not grow smaller.</p>
                <h3>Flex-Wrap</h3>
                <p>Flex wrap allows us to negate the shrinking ability of flex to fit on a line that too small for the container.Instead it will force the object to form a new line.Two properties of flex-wrap will be nowrap and wrap.</p>
                <h3>align-items, align-self, and align-content</h3>
                <p>Align items and self both control alignment but self only effects one item on the flex container while items effects all. Align content effect each new line of flex, as seen with <code>flex-wrap: wrap</code> if it needs one.For it to work, we need more height than what is required to hold the items. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Aligning_Items_in_a_Flex_Container" target="_blank">for a link to see how this works.</a></p>
                <h3>How to isolate justify-content</h3>
                <p>Justify-content does not have self or items so aligning single items doesn't work as you would expect.If we want to separate things in a nar bar we would use <code>margin-left:auto;</code>. This forces the flex items to push all the way to the right if space is available. </p>
                <h3>Justify-content flex-end</h3>
                <p>While all the other justify-content choices  are interesting, don't forget the power of flex-end and start, very easy way to push things left or right.</p>
                <h3>Flex Auto for longer text with shorter text</h3>
                <p>Flex auto works as if we enter <code>flex: 1 1 auto;</code> all items will grow and shrink from a flex-basis of auto. This would mean the longer items would take more space.</p>
                <h3>Having a flex item take most of the space</h3>
                <p>In most instances,such in forms, we can have the text take most of the available space by setting <code>flex:1 1 auto;</code></p>

                <p><a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/" target="_blank">CSS tricks offers this great cheat sheet for Flex.</a></p>
                <h3>Nav bar with controlled left and right spacing</h3>
                <p>Remember that if using ul elements, there margins and paddings must be set to 0. Using <code>justify-content:space-between</code> will push things all to the way to the left and right, but if the main container flex has a padding on the left and right, they <strong>WON'T</strong> be pushed into the padding, making a space to the left and right. </p>
                <img src="./Images/flexExercise2.png" alt="space between with space to the left and right.">
                <img src="./Images/space-betweenSpacing.png" alt="">
                <h3>Line-Height</h3>
                <p>Line height for best reading should best be set to 1.5, <code>line-height:1.5;</code>. Note: A unit can be added, but 1.5 without a unit is the best standard.</p>
                <h3>Flex height issue</h3>
                <p>Sometimes we want to have the item be center page but want to avoid doing height math. This can be fixed by placing the whole area in a <code>display: flex</code> and then giving what you want to be center a <code>flex:1</code></p>
                <h3>::before ::after</h3>
                <p>In order to do before and after, we must selection <strong>CONTAINERS</strong>, examples of containers are <kbd>DIV,p,articles,sections,etc</kbd>. Examples of things that are <strong>NOT</strong> containers are <kbd>inputs,buttons,imgs,etc.</kbd>
                <h3>Pointer Events</h3>
                <p>In some designs you will have things overlap, in order to remove interference in clickable events, simply use pointer-events.</p>
                <img src="./Images/pointerEventCS.png" alt="">
            </div>
            
          
            
        </section>
        <section id="JS" class="section__JS section">
            <h2>JS</h2>
            <div>
                <h3>What is Intersection Observer</h3>
                <p>Intersection Observer is a powerful tool that allows on scroll effects without the need for it to be called each time a scroll is done. </p>
                <h3>How does Intersection work?</h3>
                <p>Most times, intersection observer can be used with query selector to select all elements or class names, or single elements and a class name. Just note that if you do select multiple elements and classes, the steps are slightly different.</p>
                <img class="images" src="./Images/basicSkeletonIntObse.png" alt="">
                <p>options hold three values; root, threshold, and margin
                    <ul class="listMarginLeft__40px">
                        <li>root - can be left out since most times root will be set to null, or just not written out at all. Both not writing anything for null and setting it to null will both set it to the viewport as seen in the skeleton example.</li>
                        <li>threshold - a 0 to 1 scale. By default 0. 0 is when any piece of the section is in view, while 1 is when 100% of the section is visible.</li>
                        <li>rootMargin - works like margins in CSS. If wanted, it must be in parenthesis and must be in either percentage or px base. Dictates when it's fired.</li>
                        <img class="images" src="./Images/basicSkeletonIntObseRootMargin.png" alt="">
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <h3>Intersection Observer with multiple classes</h3>
                <p>For multiple classes or elements, the structure is the same as a single class or element selection. The biggest difference is that at the end when you call the observer, you need to set the variable used to hold the list with a forEach as seen on line 7 of the image.</p>
                <img class="images" src="./Images/basicSkeletonIntObse.png" alt="">
                <img src="./Images/intersectionObserverClasses.png" alt="">
                <h3>Example Of Intersection Observer with selecting only one class,toggle,with a threshold of 50% (.5).</h3>

                <img src="./Images/intersectionObserverColorChange.png" alt="">
                <p>A key thing to note that since we set the variable as colorChangeObserver instead of just observer, we must call colorChangeObserver to observer colorChange.</p>
                <h3>Prevent intersection Observer from firing all elements.</h3>
                <p>To prevent all selected elements from firing we will add an if statement to prevent this.What this also does is that when you leave the focus area, it won't fire again. Meaning that in our color change example, it would have stayed read as we passed by it. It would only fire again now when we re-enter the section, which in that case, will fire the toggle and remove the class, making it black again. The if statement is saying that if the area is <strong>NOT INTERSECTING</strong> then end the fire and don't remove the class.</p>
                <img src="./Images/intersectionObserverPreventAllFiring.png" alt="">
                <h3>To unobserve in intersection Observer</h3>
                <p>To unobserve something means that if we enter the section it will fire, but once we try to re-enter nothing will change. In the example of the color change, we will see that the color red will stay red once we pass it, and once we renter it, will stay red now.</p>
                <img src="./Images/unobserve.png" alt="">

                <h3>Fade in and out Effect with Intersection</h3>
                <p>For a simple fade in effect, use intersection observer and css transition, opacity, and transform.
                </p>
                <img src="./Images/fadeInOutJS&CSS.png" alt="">
                <img src="./Images/fadeInOutJS&CSSInter.png" alt="">

                <h3>TypeError...not an object</h3>
                <p>If you are getting this error, this is most likely due to the JS running before the element even exists on the page. Move the JS to the bottom of the webpage.</p>
                <h3>Reference error</h3>
                <p>A ReferenceError is thrown when one refers to a variable that is not declared and/or initialized within the current scope.</p>
                <h3>Syntax Error</h3>
                <p>A syntax error occurs when the code you are trying to run is not written correctly, i.e., in accordance with the grammatical rules of JavaScript.</p>
                <h3>Type Error</h3>
                <p>These errors are thrown for a few different reasons:Per MDN, a TypeError may be thrown when:an operand or argument passed to a function is incompatible with the type expected by that operator or function;or when attempting to modify a value that cannot be changed;or when attempting to use a value in an inappropriate way. Check to see if you are using the <strong>right type for the function</strong>  ie adding two strings with push can't be done since push only works with arrays, use concat instead.</p>
                <h3>Type Error</h3>
                <p>guessSubmit.addeventListener is not a function, this error is seen because we have failed to capitalize the E in event, thus check to see if you spelled all the things correctly first.</p>
                <h3>How to Name Variables</h3>
                <p>If given the task to name a variable of our current planet what would we name it? While a variable of <kbd>'planet'</kbd>  may seem enticing, given a variable of <kbd>'ourPlanetName'</kbd>  while longer, it explains a couple of things:
                    <ul class="listMarginLeft__40px">
                        <li>Who's planet are we talking about?</li>
                        <li>And what about the planet is it storing?</li>
                        <li>It's almost always better to be verbose rather than ambiguous</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <h3>Const naming and use</h3>
                <p>Const is seen with hard values, but if it's calculated, we won't capitalize the full name, if it's a hard set value, then we would have it all capitalize. An example would be our birthday is a set date, so it would be all caps, but our age changes.</p>
                <h3>NaN error</h3>
                <p>Most likely cause by using a non number in arithmetic.The result will also be NaN if NaN is used, when trying to do math with (not including +) - , * , / , % ,etc.</p>
                <h3>Appending Text</h3>
                <p>When we want to add text to an element, we will use the JS append method, seen with the rounding example</p>
                <h3>Rounding Numbers</h3>
                <p>When wanting to round, you need to create another variable and set it  <kbd>.toFixed(2)</kbd> and example would be <span class="toBeFixed"></span> being fixed to <span class="fixed"></span></p>
                <img src="./Images/fixedJS.png" alt="">
                <h3>What is a string and how do we modify them?</h3>
                <p>If you are having issues with changing strings remember that strings are <strong>IMMUTABLE</strong> meaning that any change to a string must be done with creating a new variable and setting some sort of method to the string we want to change.</p>
                <h3>Turn a string into a number</h3>
                <p>if you are having issues having number concat instead of add use <kbd>Number()</kbd> <span class="stringNumber"></span> the values should 30, but it's not since it's adding it on like a string.</p>
                <img src="./Images/stringNumberJS.png" alt="">
                <h3>Turning a Number to a string</h3>
                <p>To turn a number into a string we will use the .toString method. </p>
                <img src="./Images/" alt="">

                <h3>Using + to make strings into Numbers</h3>
                <p>Another option involves placing the + sign in front of string variables. Shorthand method of Numbers().</p>
                <img src="./Images/stringNumbersFasterJS.png" alt="">
                <h3>Using increment decrement</h3>
                <p>Using num++ or num-- will cause the value to retain the old value if never called after. Using ++num or --num will cause the value to change and be in use immediately.</p>
                <img src="./Images/increment:decrementJS.png" alt="">
                <h3>Backticks</h3>
                <p>Backticks are a version of quotes,"Backticks are “extended functionality” quotes. They allow us to embed variables and expressions into a string by wrapping them in ${…}, for example</p>
                <img src="./Images/backicksJS.png" alt="">
                <h3>Using prompt for Variable Definitions</h3>
                <p>When we want the user to enter a value,such as a temporary username, we can use the prompt function as a means to contain the value the user inputs
                </p>
                <img src="./Images/promptUserVarJS.png" alt="">
                <h3>More powers of backticks</h3>
                <p>Backticks have two other unique powers, if used inside the ${}, it can also be used for calculating a value, and if written on two separate lines, it will add the values on separate lines, similar to using \n</p>
                <img src="./Images/backTickMath.png" alt="">
                <h3>Extracting String Parts</h3>
                <p>There are three ways to extract a string, and assign it to another variable and the end is <strong>NEVER</strong> included.
                    <ul class="listMarginLeft__40px">
                        <li>Slice(start,end)</li>
                        <li>Substring(start,end)</li>
                        <li>substr(start,end)</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <h3>Slice (similar to substring)</h3>
                <p> Like all the extractions you need to assign the rest of the part to another variable.In this example, banana. If no end in inputting, it will just slice out the rest.</p>
                <img src="./Images/sliceJS.png" alt="">
                <h3>Substr()</h3>
                <p>Substr works at the start like slice, but the second value is a count from value, meaning using substr(7,6) means start at 7 and count up 6 spots instead of position based like in slice. Here we would get "BAN"</p>
                <img src="./Images/subStrJS.png" alt="">
                <h3>Making an array into a string</h3>
                <p>Combing an array can be achieved with the use of join, <span class="arrayNotJoined"></span> when joined will look like <span class="arrayJoined"></span></p>
                <img src="./Images/joinJS.png" alt="">
                <h3>Replace text with Regex</h3>
                <p>To replace words, we can use the replace method, note this returns a new string and only replaces one word unless we use regex.</p>
                <img src="./Images/replaceJS.png" alt="">
                <img src="./Images/replaceRegexJS.png" alt="">
                <h3>Pad start and Pad end</h3>
                <p>Used to add another string to current string, can add 0's or X's to the end of a current string, useful for hiding credit card numbers or social security number.This only works on strings, so if we have a number, we must first change it into a string as seen with the second image.</p>

                <img src="./Images/PadEndStringJS.png" alt="">
                <h3>Split,making a string into an array</h3>
                <p>The strength of split is that it now allows us to manipulate a string like array.</p>
                <img src="./Images/SplitJS.png" alt="">
                <h3>complete list of all string Methods</h3>

                </p>
                <h3>Power of === </h3>
                <p>A strick equality sign will first test types, meaning that if a string and a number are compared, it won't change the string into a number as seen with ==, and will instead immediately return false</p>
                <h3>Writing Else Statements</h3>
                <p>Else statements should always come at the end, since they are always run when all other conditions have failed to be met.</p>
                <img src="./Images/elseStatmentJS.png" alt="">
                <h3>Or Operator</h3>
                <p>The OR operator finds the first truthy value.Most of the time, OR || is used in an if statement to test if any of the given conditions is true.If all are false, then the last operand will be returned.This effect can also be used for a short circuit effect, meaning that a function can be called if all the operands to the left are false.</p>

                <h3>Checking Var once</h3>
                <p>A common issue when using && and || is when choosing a variable, it must be called upon each time.</p>
                <img src="./Images/operatorsPitfall.png" alt="">
                <h3>Switch Statement</h3>
                <p>
                    Switch statements can be used for checking one value at at time, but can also be used for many variables before a break, for an extensive list, follow this link <a target="_blank" href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-the-switch-statement-in-javascript">Digital Ocean</a>

                <p>When wanting to cause things to vanish from the site, it's better to look into <kbd>transform:translate3d(xpx,ypx,zpx)</kbd> where z is most likely going to be 0px, and then applying a transition on the main class.

                <h3>Local Storage and Changing Document Title</h3>
                <p>For local storage and retrieval, we use the window local storage of getItem and setItem.Once we have this, we can create an if statement to see if a stored item is present or not. It uses the first value as the key, like a variable, and the second variable will be the value of that variable, technically these are key objects pairs.Note, we didn't use the setItem of 'userName' variable since we didn't want to call the getItem local storage at this point.</p>

                <p>Setting a variable with let will only allow change to the outside if we set the variable to another variable without the let phrase. If we do decide to give the variable a new value, but use let, it <strong>WON'T</strong> change the value of the global variable.

                <h3>Argument Vs parameter</h3>
                <p>Parameters are the variables we put inside th parenthesis of functions.Arguments are the values we use for the functions. </p>
                <h3>Function Naming conventions</h3>
                <p>Functions are actions. So their name is usually a verb. It should be brief, as accurate as possible and describe what the function does, so that someone reading the code gets an indication of what the function does. It is a widespread practice to start a function with a verbal prefix which vaguely describes the action. There must be an agreement within the team on the meaning of the prefixes. For instance, functions that start with "show" usually show something. Function starting with… "get…"- return a value, "calc…" - calculate something, "create…" - create something, "check…" - check something and return a boolean, etc. Examples of such names:</p>

                <h3>When to use declaration vs function expression?</h3>
                <p>When to choose Function Declaration versus Function Expression?
                    As a rule of thumb, when we need to declare a function, the first thing to consider is Function Declaration syntax. It gives more freedom in how to organize our code, because we can call such functions before they are declared.
                    That's also better for readability, as it's easier to look up function f(…) {…} in the code than let f = function(…) {…};. Function Declarations are more “eye-catching”.
                    …But if a Function Declaration does not suit us for some reason, or we need a conditional declaration. Another note, function expressions can only work if placed first, while declarations can work any time, but only within the scope of the function if it was made in one.</p>

                    <h3>Arrow Functions</h3>
                    <p>Basic format of arrow functions
                        <code>let func = (arg1, arg2, ..., argN) => expression;
                        </code>
                    </p>
                    <h3>Problem Solve</h3>
                    <p>Follow this order when figuring out an issue
                    <ol class="listMarginLeft__40px">
                        <li>Understand the problem: Explain the problem in plain english, write it down and draw diagrams if useful.</li>
                        <li>Plan:What inputs does the program have?Where is the data? What's the desired output? And given your inputs, what are the steps to get the desired output? This last question is where the code begins.Great place to use comments in JS code.</li>
                        <li>Pseudocode: Write out the plan of attack in plain english first. An example of this will be if we are trying to print out inputted numbers. 
                            <p>"When the user inputs a number
                            Initialize a counter variable and set its value to zero.
                            While counter is smaller than user inputted number increment the counter by one.
                            Print the value of the counter variable."</p>  </li>
                        <li>Decomposition: Decomposition is the main way to deal with complexity.Work on the subproblem first, trying to make one function for the whole thing makes issues and knots later one. </li>
                    </ol>
                    </p>
                    <h3>FizzBuzz</h3>
                    <p>"Write a program that takes a user's input and prints the numbers from one to the number the user entered. However, for multiples of three print Fizz instead of the number and for the multiples of five print Buzz. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print FizzBuzz."
                        <ol class="listMarginLeft__40px">
                            <li> Understand: Write a program that allows the user to enter a number, print each number between one and the number the user entered, but for numbers that divide by three without a remainder print Fizz instead. For numbers that divide by 5 without a remainder print Buzz and finally for numbers that divide by both three and five without a remainder print FizzBuzz.</li>
                            <li>Plan: Does your program have an interface? What will it look like? Our FizzBuzz solution will be a browser console program, so we don't need an interface. The only user interaction will be allowing users to enter a number.
                            What inputs will your program have? Will the user enter data or will you get input from somewhere else? The user will enter a number from a prompt (popup box).
                            What's the desired output? The desired output is a list of numbers from 1 to the number the user entered. But each number that is divisible by 3 will output Fizz, each number that is divisible by 5 will output Buzz and each number that is divisible by both 3 and 5 will output FizzBuzz.
                            Given your inputs, what are the steps necessary to return the desired output?</li>
                            <li>Pseudocode: 
                                When a user inputs a number
                                Loop from 1 to the entered number
                                If the current number is divisible by 3 then print "Fizz"
                                If the current number is divisible by 5 then print "Buzz"
                                If the current number is divisible by 3 and 5 then print "FizzBuzz"
                                Otherwise print the current number</li>
                            <li> Decomposition:As we can see from the algorithm we developed, the first subproblem we can solve is getting input from the user. So let's start there and verify it works by printing the entered number. Next loop from 1 to the enter number. Next if it can be divided by 3 then print fizz. etc. For the rest of the explanation go to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-problem-solving"> The Odin Project</a></li>

                    <p>This mostly occurs when using an array and you make the for loop go to far. The fix to this is simply make it so that it's just less not less than or equal to. So remove the = and it'll now work without errors.</p>

               <h3>Branches</h3>
               <p>Branches can be created by going into the main github repository of whatever project you want.Then on main, create a new branch. The purpose of branches is that is allows us to create pull requests which means a member of the team can check that no crazy issues will arise in the master copy.</p>
               <h3>What is a fork and what does it do?</h3>
               <p>Allows us to have our own copy of the project of the project, copies it into a whole new repository.Mainly use when using someone elses project(s).When finished, create a pull request by going to pull request, new request, and the areas of where we want to send the pull request should be already filled if it was forked.</p>
               <h3>Owner approving pull request</h3>
               <p>If any requests are made for the owner of the original, you can accept a pull request by going into pull requests and then hit merge pull request.</p>
