        <p>During my study I found myself creating lots of empty docs that I would title "practice" or "test" and came to realize that I forget what these sections are and what I was testing. I figured making sections for these test sections will be better by creating a site that holds all my tests and that will  help me remember tips to problems.</p>

    <main id="sections" class="sections">

                    <h3>Removing lists bullet points</h3>
                    <p>To remove the bullet points in lists, you will use list-style: none</p>
                </div>
        </section>
        <section id="CSS" class="section__CSS section">
            <h2>CSS</h2>
            <div>
                <h3>Relative and Absolute</h3>
                <p>Position relative is based off its relative position but can be adjusted with left,top,right,and bottom. The power of Relative is that it make position absolute relative to position relative.</p>
                <h3>FontAwesome</h3>
                <p>The best way to add FontAwesome will be to add it via download. The file at the moment would need to be downloaded each time and then moved either into it's own folder on the site you're working on in VS code.Next, you will need to move down the file until you hit css/all.min. Another think you can do is delete the other files in FontAwesome to save some space, ie anything in JS and less. </p>
                <h3>Choice of Border Color</h3>
                <p>Choosing a border the color of the main text seems best, choose your color and lower the opacity until you get the desire color.</p>
                <h3>Background-size vs Background-position</h3>
                <p>Background-size has to do with how large the img should behave, this is where we see contain and cover. Contain being it showing the whole img, and if it doesn't cover the whole area the empty space will take up the background-color prop, but the img will never be cropped.cover is when the img filled the container fully, and does crop the img if the container isn't large enough.Background-position has to do with where you want the img to be viewed, this is the one where you use center,left,right,etc</p>
                <h3>Color Scheme: How to choose your colors</h3>
                <p>First go into the following site <a href="https://www.designspiration.com/search/saves/?q=colour" target="#">Color Picker</a>, and to help narrow the search on colors think of a couple things 
                <ol class="colorChooser__list">
                <li>Target Audience, a funeral home vs fast food will use different colors.</li>
                <li>Does the Logo offer any colors?</li>
                <li>Play the word game, write down things that remind you of your site, and you should think of what color define these.</li>
                </ol>
                some quick tips, a lighter shade works more for fresh energy brands, while darker ones are more for corporate serious brands. Next you want to keep in mind that most sites will use three base colors, white, gray, and a light gray. With this in mind, you will choose only a base color, the color you choose when you were thinking of a color at the list above,and an accent color. Once you have your color, go to <a href="https://paletton.com/#uid=1000u0kllllaFw0g0qFqFg0w0aF" target="#">accent color finder</a>.Enter your color into the wheel, and then click on add complimentary color near right of the selections. The color red below is #FFA5A5 and acts as the accent while the green below is #9AEE9C,and acts as the base color. After the accent, you will use two different grays, a darker and lighter one.The dark one is used for text. The gray needed can be find by entering your based color into the search bar of <a href="https://dribbble.com/" target="#">Dribble</a> and find a gray that matches your color choice.
                <div class="colorChooser__baseAndAccentColor"></div>
                The main color will be used for large areas and icons. The accent color for buttons and smaller areas, call to action areas.Dark gray for text and icon outlines, and the white and light gray are used for the background.
                Another tip will be to set everything to gray scale and then add color later.
